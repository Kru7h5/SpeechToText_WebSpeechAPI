It was recommended to me by a friend who had stayed there previously.  The hostel is located in a quaint little town called Cumberland, which is about 10 minute drive from Courtenay on Vancouver Island.  There is a bunch of info about the actual hostel on the web site if you want more information about the actual amenities etc so I won\\'t duplicate that info here.\\n\\nThe hostel is run by Jeremy and is above Dodge City Cycles which is a bicycle shop located in the main street.  The first thing that really struck me is the host Jeremy, he\\'s a fantastic person who takes an interest in the guests and really seems to care about them and goes out of his way to ensure that they have an enjoyable stay.  He\\'s also very knowledgeable and is able to provide lots of tips about the area and suggest things you can do.  He\\'s a mad keen mountain biker as well for all you MTB\\'ers out there :-)\\n\\nThe other thing that you\\'ll notice about the hostel is that it is very well maintained and clean and there are enough bathrooms available for the number of guests that can stay in the hostel.\\n\\nThe wireless internet access is free and is very reliable and fast and there is a common computer that you can use if you don\\'t have a laptop.  There are also cruiser bicycles available which you can take for a ride, although I didn\\'t do that given that it was winter!  The common kitchen is well equipped and there is a good system for everyone to keep their food clearly identified.  The common room has a pool table and Jeremy ran a Pizza and Video night whilst I was there which went down extremely well with everyone :-)\\n\\nI was staying there during the winter and so a good number of the people staying at the hostel were long term guests who were working up at Mount Washington Alpine Resort for the season.  I found the long term residents to be great and really friendly.  Unlike some of the hostels I have stayed at, there was very little of the late night antics or noise that you typically associate with hostels.\\n\\nIn terms of the actual town of Cumberland, it\\'s a quiet place but the local Waverley Hotel is pretty good and has a half price burger night on Tuesdays which is great value for money and the hotel also gets some live bands in.  The Indian restaurant nearby is also very good.  There are places in the town to buy basic groceries, but if you want a good selection you\\'ll need to go shopping in Courtenay.\\n\\nIt was a great place to stay and everyone was very welcoming.  I would highly recommend that you check it out!!!",5,positive

The lodge is a favourite among Europeans, and we understand that groups often fly in on package plans.  ALL guest structures at Ten-ee-ah are of modern log construction, from the lodge itself (dining room, lounge in front of the huge stone fireplace, gift shop, huge outdoor deck), to numerous guest cabins.  The cabins run from  studio size for couples to one- and two-bedroom cabins for larger groups.  My wiife and I stayed in a on-bedroom and found it clean and well-appointed.  Full kitchen, bathroom (shower only).  If you need extra blankets or towels, the staff are glad to help.  No guest rooms in the lodge itself.  German is spoken by most of the staff.\\n\\nThe restaurant serves three meals.  Some package plans include meals.  Cuisine is often Swiss in tone , but Ten--ee-ah often features Canadian game meats in season--elk, moose, deer, and a variety of game birds, in addition to customary beef, chicken and some seafood.  Sauces and desserts are usually exotic and rich, but the staff will try to accommodate your special requests, with adequate warning.  The wine list is standard\\nDining here is NOT cheap, so if your dish is not 100% to uour liking, let staff know and they will do their best to make you happy.  Ten--ee-ah subscribes to that wonderful European protocol of asking if you\\'d like some more (main entree).  No extra charge.\\n\\nThe lodge property is right on Spout Lake and you can take out a canoe or rowboat at will.  These craft are equipped with paddles, motors, life jackets, etc.  Spout Lake has a lot of reeds growing close to shore,  so you\\'ll want to swim off the end of the long dock, or enter the water off a boat further out in the lake.  I think you can rent fishing gear (we didn\\'t fish,so you\\'ll have to check that info on your own).  Snowfall in the region is generally heavy, so a variety of winter activities are possible, from snowshoeing and cross-country skiing, to dog sledding (make sure dogs are &quot;in residence&quot; before you book).\\n\\nStaying and dining at this well-appointed lodge in its magnificent wilderness setting are special treats..It is not cheap, but then Ten-ee-ah delivers a high-end product on every level,  and most  of us don\\'t mind a splurge now and again when we get the kind of value places like Ten-ee-ah deliver.\\n\\nEndnote:  my wife and I live in Lac la Hache, so we\\'ve been to this lodge for meals many times in all seasons.

A perfect place to relax in a quiet atmosphere! Most activities are located on or around the lake: Canoes are provided free of charge, while we rented serveral times a small motor boat, to explore the long streching lake. Furthermore, several foot paths are marked. The lodge additionally offers guided horseback tours and flights with float planes. I regret not having taken this opportunity!\\n\\nWe enjoyed very friendly hospitality and tasty food offering both north amercian and european cuisine at this wonderful location. We will come back on our next trip in beautiful British Columbia and can really recommand Ten-ee-ah Lodge.\\n\\nFinally two aspects to consider:\\n- the lodge is run by a very friendly and helpful Swiss familiy, also staff is Swiss by majority. So for some visitors from german speaking countries it might be convient to be able to communicate in their mothertongue. Also a vast majority of fellow guests turned out to be Swiss or German during our stay. Depending on what kind of &quot;canadian expericence&quot; you are looking for, this should be considered however.\\n- don\\'t underestimate travel times when arriving from Vancouver by car, as we did (or heading back there), I highly recommend to get an early start, as the drive is very scenic, but also time consuming.",5,positive

data/ca/1050306/1161955/536209185.html,Ten-ee-ah Lodge,"""Received a recommendation from Tenzing Travel to include this place on our RV road trip through Canada. The place is VERY secluded. Expect a 45 minute (21 km) drive over a dirt road to get to this place. Not the most convenient with an RV but especially when it hasn\\'t rained its doable. There are very few signs so just keep driving on the dirt road until you see the big brown Ten Ee Ah sign on your right hand side when coming from the South or left hand side when coming from the North. Beware that Google Maps incorrectly lists its location so don\\'t rely on that. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. It\\'s a location of true silence. The only sound you hear is either from birds or the electricity generator that supplies the whole place with electricity. It\\'s located right on a beautiful lake. There are horses walking around freely. There\\'s a little self made treehouse, a sandbox, soccer table and a trampoline for kids. RV places include 15 amp electricity but no water or sewer hookups. Also a table and fire pit can be found. Firewood is available for free. There\\'s free WiFi at the restaurant between 10 am and 6 pm and between 8 pm and midnight. It goes via satellite though and is very slow and unreliable so even web browsing is pretty much impossible. Electricity gets shut down between midnight and 6 am. They offer package deals which include breakfast and dinner but we found them to be extremely expensive (190$ for 2 adults per day versus 40$ for just the RV site without electricity). Restrooms and showers are decent and clean. There are washing facilities for 8$ for the washer and 5$ for the dryer. 2 hours of horse riding costs 75$. There\\'s a dump station with water fill on site. When we were there around end of May there was a bizarre plague of mosquitos. We and our kids got stung everywhere all the time. Even inside our RV with everything shut they managed to find ways inside. Horrific night and experience so we left first thing next morning again. Because I do see the beauty of such a remote place away from the rest of the world I still give it a 3 out of 5 rating, but knowing the long detour in our route we had to take to get there, the 45 minute dirt road you rather don\\'t want to drive on with a rented RV, the mosquito plague and the high prices you pay for everything there, I would definitely not recommend it to others to add this to their itinerary unless you dedicate your vacation to just going to such a place and dont go in the May and June months as those have the mosquito plague.",3,negative

The quiet time was never enforced so if you\\'re there for a family reunion or other big gathering it definitely is a good choice, but if you\\'re not part of the group it can get a little annoying at times.  The facilities were clean but seemed a little run down,  it reminded me more of a provincial park than a privately run resort. We were disappointed and won\\'t be staying there again but that doesn\\'t mean is a bad place to stay it just didn\\'t fit what we want and expect when we go camping.",3,negative

We found the service and overall caring of the owner ( older German couple)to be rude and just dry but didn\\'t make a deal of it as we were in our RV doing our own things. We came back there yesterday and decided to book 2 nights in their little apartments they also have on site. Cost $238 for 2 nights. First surprise is that the place does not provide towels. We were told by the lady that it was clearly indicated on their Web site .... but she eventually gave us few towels. The second surprise was when we walked in the apartment.... rated from the 80\\'s, smelly, spiders and spider webs all over the place. My wife and I looked at each other speechless and immediately regreted and thought : what did we get into. It was late and we turned the TV on and watched 2 Broke Girls (Photo attached). The place was cold as they\\'d just turned the heat on. The bed had no sheets, only a smaller quilt and two pillows so I went to the office and asked the lady for extra sheets and pillows. She looked at me literally insulted and said &quot;isn\\'t there enough in there already ?&quot; &quot; You know you can turn the heat on more&quot; .... Really ??? \\nI went back to the office later in an attempt to get the wifi password and figure out how the TV works. We were the only ones in the entire resort that night and they turned all of their office lights off at 20:30 to make sure we were not going to disturb them further. \\nWorst sleep ever, so we decided to not stay the second night and spoke with the male owner at 7:30 the next morning and informed him of our decision not to stay and asked for a credit. &quot;Nope!, you paid for 2 night and it is it!&quot; &quot;Not our problem&quot;. &quot;The Web site clearly states 2 nights minimum and no refund&quot;. Really ??? \\nSo we left a bit upset, and went to 100 Mile House and rented out night at the Ramada for another $128 which also had a kitchenette and proper matching bedding and supplies, free WiFi, breakfast and fresh smell. \\nI recommend you stay in one of the many hotels in 100 Mile House when in the area and absolutely avoid the Ponderosa Resort as this old couple should perhaps just learn how to treat their customers with respect.",1,negative

We had a 120 person ceremony right on the beach with the beautiful Canim Lake landscape as our backdrop that followed a full reception in the outdoor covered barn type building. Our wedding was everything I always dreamed of plus more, Karin and Wolf gang were so easy going and helpful during the planning process and the whole week that we were there. I would recommend the Ponderosa Resort to any couple looking to plan a beautiful rustic wedding or family looking to book their next family reunion. Our cabin was so lovely and was perfect for all of us girls to get ready in on the big day! its also such a bonus having all the condos there for guests that don\\'t have a trailer or don\\'t like tenting.

The beach is rocky but the water is lovely.  There were a few glitches in the reservation so I would caution you to double check your confirmation.

data/ca/10521894/10006340/588668887.html,Holiday Inn Express &amp; Suites Terrace,"""The Holiday Inn Express is a relatively new hotel in Terrace (sorry, Thornhill, you\\u2019ll always be Terrace to me!). It combines modern furnishings with exemplary customer service which, taken together, results in an excellent hotel stay. Thanks to the easy-going and personable staff, when you stay here, it almost feels like \\u201chome.\\u201d\\n\\nLocated out in Thornhill, the hotel is a few minutes\\u2019 drive from the downtown core of Terrace. For some this might be a bit of an inconvenience, especially if you\\u2019re without wheels, but for me it wasn\\u2019t an issue at all. Personally, I thought the location was more than ideal: Being away from downtown, the area was a lot quieter and thus resulted in a better sleep quality. As well, the hotel is barely a 5-minute drive from Terrace Airport which, for me, was another clear and definite plus. Even if one happened to be sans car, there are other amenities within walking distance. For example, the NMI offers a decent food selection as does the nearby Thornhill Meat Market (perfect for some hot foods and sundries).\\n\\nAs for the hotel itself, as I said, this is a new building. The exterior is clean and welcoming; there is ample free parking; and once indoors, you\\u2019re greeted by friendly staff and a modern, bright interior. The main lobby/seating area is colourful \\u2013 with chairs \\u201cpopping\\u201d out at you in an array of pleasing colours and tones like red, orange and blue. The off-white tiling of the floor and walls serves as the perfect complement to the warm setting. The lobby area also features a small business centre and nearby snack shop to satisfy those late night cravings.\\n\\nGiven the nature of small town hotels, you might expect service to be a little sleepy at times, but that\\u2019s not the case here. Check-in, whether at mid-day or midnight, has always been a breeze (and the same goes for check-out). As well as the aforementioned snack shop, the hotel also boasts a modest pool, gym facilities, laundry room, complimentary WiFi and meeting room area.\\n\\nAs far as accommodations go, the rooms in this hotel are easily some of the best in Terrace. They\\u2019re bright, clean, spacious, wonderfully appointed and contain all of the modern amenities that we\\u2019ve come to expect of any good hotel: Consistent WiFi access, quality sheets and pillows, air conditioning, flat screen LCD TVs, mini fridge, coffee maker, large sliding-door shower, quality bath products, and numerous plugs for our beloved mobile devices. I also appreciated the large desk with elevated lighting \\u2013 perfect for working on my laptop late into the night.\\n\\nThe hotel does not have a restaurant per se, but it does offer complimentary hot breakfast every morning in the main lobby/lounge area. What I like about this is that it\\u2019s not your standard \\u201ccontinental breakfast\\u201d (i.e.: cereal and a muffin); rather, it features a number of hot items like sausage meat, bacon, turkey sausage, eggs, omelettes, pancakes (make them yourself). Fruit, cereals, bread and various juices are also on offer. Besides breakfast, this Holiday Inn also features a \\u201cpizza party night,\\u201d done in partnership with the local Domino\\u2019s, every Tuesday from 6pm-7pm. The party features a wide array and variety of pizzas, all of which are complimentary to hotel guests. I\\u2019ve taken advantage of this feature a few times and really appreciate it.\\n\\nIn summary, the Terrace Holiday Inn is a hotel that punches well above its weight. It offers guests a clean, modern space within which to relax while concomitantly providing exceptional services. At an average cost of $125 CAD a night, this hotel offers superb value for money \\u2013 I\\u2019ll definitely be returning!",5,positive

Nothing that would deter us from staying again, more just things to note. First, when you request a one bedroom suite, be warned it is not a separate bedroom. We expected a separate sleeping quarters as we were travelling with young children and it\\u2019s nice to be able to stay up when they go to bed early. However, what we got was a few extra feet of space and a three foot pony wall between the bed and the sofa. It\\u2019s essentially just an oversized room. Not a suite. Second, the soundproofing leaves something to be desired. At 8:30pm we received a noise complaint from the person below us saying we had heavy feet. We were literally just walking, and barely walking at that. We were afraid to walk around the room! Later we could very clearly hear the footsteps of the people above us as they moved around their room, and I doubt they were going out of their way to be noisy, so I guess it\\u2019s just poor soundproofing between floors.",4,positive

Upon our arrival, we were welcomed by Jeff, who showed us to our accommodations, the Woodpecker suite, located on the second floor. This was the 4th B&amp;B into our 3 week trip and the best. Their home was built some time ago.  This experience is not about Egyptian sheets and thread count, fancy soaps and 20&quot; mattresses. It is about the comfort and hospitality that Anneke and Jeff understand how to provide.  It is the warmth and coziness of the surroundings that puts you at ease, that help you to relax and enjoy your time there . Anneke and Jeff are pros. They are prepared and willing to assist you with your itinerary, share favorite swimming holes, places to eat, etc. We were on the go and cramming a lot in to two days. Anneke made a comment about how people sometimes try to see too much, leaving too little time to truly take it all in and enjoy what\\'s around them.  In hindsight, we wish we had listened.  In addition to her wisdom, she sure knows how to cook! We were stunned when we saw our breakfast. Fine china, breakfast cocktails with sugared rimmed glasses, entrees plated with fresh flowers, homemade scones, pancakes...more food than anyone could dream of eating and it was all wonderful. Our second night I had injured my ankle earlier in the day and was in a great deal of discomfort. They were right there to help in any way they could and very thoughtful. If you are looking for comfort, peace and quiet, true hospitality, good company, genuine kindness and a couple with warm hearts and good souls, then this is the place for you. Thank you Anneke &amp; Jeff, we hope to return soon and stay longer! A&amp;S",5,positive

Had to wait until the next day to get a pair.\\n4) The front door of the cabin would not lock and we had to stick around for 3 hours.  This was just after we checked in. The lock got reset and it seemed to work again.  However, I was a little surprised with the comment that we could leave the door unlocked as their was no history of theft at the resort...how safe is that?",2,negative

Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay at the Days Inn and I would stay there again.\\n\\nThis was my first time visiting Tumbler Ridge, so I didn\\'t know my way around town. Despite this, I found the hotel very quickly, just outside of the city centre. This is a very new hotel, having just opened in 2008, so the parking lot was not finished when I stayed there. I assume it will be paved very shortly. \\n\\nTumbler Ridge is a lovely community and quite safe as a whole, and this hotel\\'s location is no exception. I felt well at ease during my stay. The hotel is a favourite among the work crews employed in the surrounding areas of Tumbler Ridge, so it can have a bit of an industrial feel to it, but guests of all backgrounds will feel comfortable here.\\n\\nI stayed on the first floor, in a suite facing the parking lot. I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the room. It was very large, with exceptionally high ceilings. There was a kitchen area, a living room, and a bedroom separated by French doors. \\n\\nThe bedroom was very nice, with a lovely bed covered in a fluffy white duvet, fluffy white pillows and soft white linens. The mattress was quite comfortable. Also in the bedroom were two night stands, a leather armchair in the corner, and a closet. For those who like to watch TV while in bed, I should mention that there wasn\\'t a TV in the bedroom. \\n\\nThe living room was nice but felt a little empty. There weren\\'t any paintings or pictures, but I chalked this up to the hotel being new. I assume the decorating will be completed in the near future. There was a large leather couch in the living room and a glass-covered coffee table. I\\'m not a fan of unsecured glass panels on table tops, especially when kids will be around. Hopefully they plan to insert adhesive or grip tabs to prevent the panels from being pushed around and becoming hazards. \\n\\nAlso in the living area was a TV, a working desk and a leather office chair. I was happy to find that standard satellite television was provided. Given the remote location of Tumbler Ridge, I had not planned on this being a given. Lighting was quite limited in the living room. I\\'m not sure if they\\'re planning to install more fixtures on the ceiling or simply add some lamps, but more lighting is definitely needed.\\n\\nThe kitchen was quite large, and included stools at the counter, a microwave, oven, stove, fridge, and a sink. It was also well-stocked with cooking utensils, cutlery, dishware and basic linens. Overall, the kitchen was pretty clean, but I did notice food (fries and other bits) between the kitchen cabinet and the fridge, and along the bottom of the cabinets. \\n\\nThe bathroom was on the small side, as I have noticed is the trend at Days Inn and Super 8 hotels. As I have mentioned in my other reviews, these bathrooms present a minor inconvenience to solo/business travellers, but could be quite bothersome for a family. Aside from that, the towels were clean, as were the shower and toilet. Basic supplies (shampoo, soap, etc.) were supplied, as usual. \\n\\nThe hotel staff I encountered were very nice and happy to help. Being unfamiliar with Tumbler Ridge, I called the front desk and a staff member kindly provided directions to the places I needed to go, and answered my many questions about services and businesses in Tumbler Ridge. \\n\\nThere is small convenience store on-site, operated by the hotel itself. It\\'s located in a room next to the check-in counter. I was able to go in, help myself to snacks, drinks, and other basic items, and then pay at the check-in counter. This is very convenient for anyone that may arrive after the local grocery store downtown closes. \\n\\nIn the morning, a deluxe continental breakfast is provided in a seating area just off of the lobby. I was running late and didn\\'t get a chance to have any, but it smelled good!\\n\\nFinally, a quick overview of other amenities at this hotel that I didn\\'t have a chance to use/look at, but are worth noting: Exercise room, free 24-hour business self-serve centre, high-speed Internet in all rooms (surprising!), and in-room safes. \\n\\nOverall, I had a nice stay. They still have some bugs to work out, which is to be expected with a brand-new property, but I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends or colleagues visiting Tumbler Ridge.",4,positive

When this closed in 2000, the community succeeded in keeping the town alive, and it still boasts impressive facilities and elegant layouts.

The Elevator was out of service during our stay so we had to use the stairs to get to our floor, you could very clearly see the layers of dust and dirt along the side of the stairs where feet don\\'t normally tread. As well, the hand rails and door handles were just dirty. The walls, carpeting, fixtures etc are just old and dated and really showing their age, even a little coat of paint in the halls would go a long way to improving things. \\n\\nThe room itself, a two bedroom suite, was good, although it also had the old smoke smell to it as well. After leaving the patio door and windows open for a while the smell definitely reduced. Over all the rooms were cleaner and had a better \\'feel\\' than the rest of the hotel, when checking in I began to get very skeptical of what the rooms were going to be like, thankfully they were better than the rest of the place. However, they are showing their age and wear as well, from scuff marks and dents in walls and doors to the general worn look of furniture. \\n\\nA final note is on hotel security. This is the only hotel where I have seen it to be common practice to place a rock to keep the side door (at the bottom of the exit stairwell) open so that people can come and go that way, needless to say this will let anyone into the hotel. \\n\\nFor this apartment to hotel conversion, I think what would be helpful is if they moved beyond just doing superficial cleaning and made more of an effort to removed buildup, scuff marks (magic erasers work very well) and just improve the overall cleanliness, beyond that, some fresh paint and new carpeting in halls would take things to a new level. The options in TR are very limited, however there ARE options.",3,negative

There was some kind of leak in the bathroom that created a puddle that expanded into the room making for some wet carpet. I complained at the front desk and they brought some towels to the room to soak it up. The floor was spongy and bounced in places. The air conditioner was loud and did little to cool the room.

Shortly we were wading into the river and jumping into the raft, excited for the adventure ahead.\\n\\nThe river was teeming with salmon, although there seemed to be as many dead salmon and skeletons as there were living, spawning ones.\\n\\nThe fog turned to cold drizzle, but we were cozy and dry as Jake handed out hot chocolate, explaining that this was actually the best sort of day for observing these huge predator birds. He was right\\u2014there were eagles everywhere we looked.\\n\\nIt was fascinating to listen to Jake, a volunteers and supporter of Squamish Environment Society\\u2019s Eagle Watch program, as we learned interesting facts about bald eagles, from their rapid growth, needing to eat 10% of their body weight each day, how they feed near the river, but sleep in trees a few hundred metres back where it\\u2019s a few degrees warmer, and the direct connection between the eagles, salmon and the surrounding ecosystem.\\n\\nIt felt like a privilege to be so close to these huge birds as we silently drifted downriver.\\n\\nAfter an 90 minutes on the water, we were warming up with hot drinks by the fire back at Sunwolf Lodge, followed by delicious homemade chilli (with Brad\\u2019s pulled pork we smelled in the morning!) and freshly baked bread and cookies.\\n\\nThe whole experience was magical, especially considering that we were back in the city in early afternoon. We\\u2019re already planning to go back for another round in the summer when they offer whitewater rafting\\u2014and to try more things on the menu at Fergie\\u2019s Cafe.\\n\\nOf course no Foodists adventure would be quite complete without Nathan shoving a camera in my face, so we cobbled together a little video of our adventure.

It is such a cozy log cabin in a beautiful, stunning spot (the photos really don\\'t do it justice- you can see the mountains so clearly and that doesn\\'t show up in the photos at all!). The cabin itself has everything you need for a great time away- more than fully stocked kitchen (coffee maker; full-size fridge, oven, microwave; kettles; plenty of kitchenware), two beds that sleep great, two couches, table, games, satellite TV, movies, and books. There are life-jackets and oars for the canoe, as well as a picnic table, chairs and beds outside, a fire pit and seats for it, a full propane BBQ, many walking trails, and two bikes available for use. It really has it all- and the one thing it doesn\\'t have is noise! It is so quiet! Unbelievably quiet at night, except for a few loons (who pop up and dive down into the lake constantly), and during the day, the only noise comes from the occasional boat or seaplane. And you can see the lake from all windows because the property is surrounded by the lake on three sides. It\\'s stunning. Andy &amp; Jane are about the nicest people you will ever meet- so open and friendly, ready to help in any way possible- they live on the other side of the property. Within a 10 minute drive is a restaurant and general store. The store is fairly large, including liquor and many frozen and non-perishable items. They are limited in fresh products, like fruits, veggies, and bakery (though they do have it but they seem to sell out fast), so we suggest bringing some fresh veggies and fruits from Williams Lake if you want to save some money and have a better selection. Or just, 20 minute drive down the road brings you to Anaham Lake, which has three or more general stores and other options for fresh products. 2.5 hours further down Highway 20 (which surprisingly turns into a gravel road past Anaham Lake!), you get to beautiful Bella Coola, which has Co-Op, some other shops, post office, bank, museum, many tours and trails, and ferry connection to Vancouver Island. After 5 days at A&amp;J B&amp;B, we felt so rested, but also felt like we had some adventures on the day trips, walking tours, and canoe rides on the lake. Highly recommended!",5,positive

Fresh water from the glacial streams, fresh rainbow trout from lake, a cosy cabin and the ability to make a make-shift fridge from permanent ice-shelves nearby. It was certainly warm enough to be dressed in shorts and t-shirt at that time of year, the only reason to cover-up and the only negative was the amount of mosquitoes and horse flies, but that goes with the territory and on a day with a good breeze they didn\\u2019t cause too much annoyance. The cabin had gas for the hob and lights, and a wood burning stove. We cooked our fish on the fire outside, plus there was the option of the hob.

The wildlife alone makes this a very special place. The staff is that perfect blend of professional without being solicitous, while making you feel welcome and part of the family.

Both this year &amp; last year our visit began with sitings of gray whales and humpbacks on our skiff ride to the lodge. Last year 3 grays surrounded our boat &amp; the driver was very cool with staying as long as we liked to watch them; they were 10 feet away! It was late July &amp; we fished for 2 days &amp; caught our limit of King &amp; Coho. Barkley Sound was full of humpbacks, which was a thrill to watch. This year we hit the jackpot. We brought another couple &amp; the fellows rode out to the south shole &amp; limited in King, Coho &amp; Halibut (though the halibut was small), and we saw a humpback &amp; her calf breach not even 100 years from our skiff - check out my photo! My girlfriend &amp; I hiked the trails that were filled with moss-covered trees &amp; patrolled by eagles, and Eagle Nook provided the bear spray, which we, thankfully, didn\\'t need! We hiked to a pristine beach where anyone could feel comfortable sun bathing - nude or not. Afterwards we treated ourselves to massages &amp; facials...it just doesn\\'t get any better! They also offered kyaking &amp; paddle boarding, but we were feeling a bit too lazy...&amp; preferred to enjoy the Canadian beer &amp;  a little R &amp; R instead. There is wi-fi, movies &amp; games, including a pool table, but I recommend disconnecting instead; sit back &amp; let Eagle Nook take care of you. \\n\\nDinner is always superb, and the outside fire-pit &amp; hot tub are ready to go.

It was again a wonderful trip and one to remember for the future, for sure. Always looking forward to board that 1953 Beech 18 operated by Pacific Seaplanes from Vancouver to the resort which is already an adventure itself. Greeted by the friendly staff when landed right in front of the lodge, we feel welcomed and they take good care of us. Well, and there is Matt, our fishing guide \\u2014 I have to say, I enjoy the time on your boat not only because of the fishing, but also because of the conversation and the music. \\u2018Seasons\\u2019 \\u2014 the song of the trip. Last but not least, since it\\u2019s about fishing, this year was probably the best out of all. We had 2 1/2 good days already as we got our daily limits quickly when we went for that last halibut on day 4. Expecting for it to be a soso day to get that last halibut, we anchored, set the gear and bait, waited, and watched the ocean when we saw a school of cohos skimming the surface for all the bait fish there was. We took our other fishing pols, jigged for the salmon and got one after another. I wish I had my fly with me and will for sure bring it the next time. Lots of fun for my son and I and I am sure we will talk about it in years to come. Of course, my son was way better than I in getting the fish in, but that is another story.\\nOne thing I also want to mention is that we like the resort as it is private, not fancy, food is good including lunch and dinner and I like the new hot breakfast. Maybe it\\u2019s time for some upgrades to keep up with the time and the young generation to come, but I am sure Dan has this already on his radar.\\nAnd wait, a special thank you to the staff who handles and packages the catch for us. We really appreciate what you do for us! Just put a marker somewhere not to pack more than 23 Kg in one box for your international customers.

There are dual rolling blinds to black out the window and the lighting is ample and easily controlled. The washroom is well laid out and everything functions properly. A fridge and microwave are standard options in HIE properties. The internet is not blazing fast but acceptable, stable and included in the room rate.

data/ca/1172384/8538052/610669659.html,Holiday Inn Express &amp; Suites Victoria - Colwood,"""First let me say that the room is fine and the breakfast is great. But I am unlikely to stay here again for two reasons:\\n\\n1) The reservation was made at a corporate rate by the company that had engaged my services. Everything was fine when I checked in, but later the woman at the front desk saw me coming into the hotel with my wife, and asked if that was my wife. I thought it strange at the time but I just confirmed and nothing else was said. When I went to check out, I found that she increased my room rate by over 75% (which added a total of over $500 to my total bill) because, as they told me, the reservation was made for 1 person and they adjusted it because there were 2 people. I have traveled worldwide must of my life and never heard of any hotel doing such a thing before. We did get it corrected, but was not happy about the delay because we were rushing to the airport to catch a flight. I might add, the rate that they adjusted it to ($314/night) was higher than any rate that I could find on their site and when I tried changing from 1 to 2 people, the rate on their site does not change). This alone is enough to make me avoid them in the future.\\n\\n2) Their credit card reader was having problems, and according to the Royal Bank (who I called after I found out my card was locked) it appears that the problems with the machine at the hotel were somehow sending erroneous PIN numbers to the system. The person at the Hotel said she has seen that before and blamed it on car rental company pre-authorization.\\n\\nAs I said, we were happy with the facilities and room, but that first issue really leaves me with a very negative impression. Once the rate is agreed upon, the hotel should not blindly change it, especially without even discussing it with the customer. In my opinion, that is at least unethical.",3,negative

Even when the room was cleaned the 3rd day none of the shampoos or conditioners were filled so we had none. Also the sink drain didn\\u2019t work well causing the sink to always fill which is generally gross. All this led me to be concerned about how well the room had been cleaned before we arrived.

I called the hotel direct to book a one night stay, as I find it is often easier to talk to the actual hotel than to go through a booking agent. \\n\\nWhen we went to check in, they said we were on 2nd floor and at the total opposite end of the hotel. I said I needed the room to be at least on the ground floor due to my Mom not being able to do stairs easily. They said no they couldn\\'t change us as all the rooms on the ground floor were occupied. I explained that I had called the hotel directly instead of going though a booking agent like trip advisor or similar. Nope still not able to change anything. So I said fine as we were only staying one night, but that I wasn\\'t impressed. We hadn\\'t even gotten out the second set of doors when the manager (I\\'m guessing that\\'s who he was) came running after us and said that maybe after all they could accommodate us with a ground floor room. I went back in, while my Mom continued to the car, and they changed out my key card. We were still at the opposite end of the hotel but at least on the ground floor. \\nThe maid was in the process of vacuuming the room when we got there, we stayed out of her way while she finished. It was a decent sized room with 2 double beds (possibly queens) There was a small fridge, and coffee maker there. We decided that the room must be in the process of being reno\\'d as there was a hole in the bathroom wall. The carpet did have some black stains near the sink. There was only wires hanging where the smoke alarm should have been. When I went to turn on the heat there was 2 tree air fresheners stuck in the fan side, luckily they were old enough to have lost all their scent. \\nThey did have decent wifi and the code was written right on the key card holder so I didn\\'t have to search for the code or call the front desk. \\n Mom and I unpacked and went out for the rest of the day. We returned late and decided not to bother with the pool as it was at the opposite end from where we were. The manager had told us when we checked in that breakfast was 7-9am. So when we got up the next morning Mom went to have a shower and there was no hot water. There was also no plug for the bath, but we wouldn\\'t be having a bath anyway so it wasn\\'t a bother. We couldn\\'t\\' even get hot water to wash our faces properly. We did mention this to the girl at the front desk when we went for breakfast and she said that we must not have ran the water long enough, my Mom asked how long should she have run it as she had ended up having a cold shower and it hadn\\'t even started to warm up by the time she finished (a very quick shower mind you).\\nWent to the lobby for the continental breakfast, there was waffles and bread to toast. Only peanut butter and raspberry jam for our toast, no butter just margarine(one of my favourite things for continental breakfast is being able to have marmalade - just a quirk of mine). 2 types of cereal (we don\\'t eat cereal so didn\\'t check to see what kind) There was a juice machine, I had orange juice whcih tasted watered down. Mom had coffee no complaints. They had a bowl of apples for fresh fruit. \\nAll in all a disappointment from when we stayed before.

Unfortunately, our experience with this hotel was barely average so I gave it a poor :( \\n\\nWe had just traveled 8 hours to reach Abbotsford and were leaving at 430am to make a ferry crossing to the island. We picked up our room keys (lovely lobby, we were looking forward to seeing our room) - only to find ourselves in the second building, with only one entrance, and up on the top floor in the very very very back room. We had to drag the two kiddos and all of our gear up there, up the stairs and down two long hallways. We unloaded the kids and pajamas and then opened the fridge to put our drinks, sandwiches, and ice packs in - only to discover that the freezer part was completely frozen solid. We did not want to have to change rooms just because of a little freezer door, so we turned off the unit and left the door open to thaw it out. \\n\\nI took the kids to the pool, which was fine and warm - they did enjoy that part. But when we returned to the room, the freezer door was ready to open - only for us to find that the entire interior was full of frost/ice. In total it took more than 4 hours to defrost the freezer enough to stuff our ice bags in there. I went to the front desk, in the main building, to ask if there was any milk I could have for the kids but I was told no. I explained about the freezer and said it took 4 hours to thaw, and the front desk clerk said she was very sorry, but we still had to go to the store down the road to get milk (our milk was no longer cold since we didnt have a fridge for so long). That bothered me because the hotel does a full breakfast every morning and I know milk was served, so I am not sure why someone could not have found us even two glasses of it. Strange.\\n\\nThe room was small, probably a special price because it is one of the least desirable rooms - but we booked it almost 2 months ago and the charge came off our credit card immediately, so you would think for an advance booking we would get a decent room that had actually been checked for everything to be in working order. We stayed in 4 different Best Western hotels on this week-long trip and Abbotsford Regency is the only one I will be giving a low rating to.

There were a few hiccups this time but overall the experience was great. The hotel is located just off highway one.  I would say that if you are sensitive to sound, you may want to request a room that is further away from the highway side.  I was located fairly close to the highway side but I am a sounds sleeper.  Use your discretion.  That being said, the fast access to the highway was one of the reasons it was chosen.  I need to get quickly out to Mission, Chillwack and other parts of Abbotsford and it is very convenient that way.  The rooms are a bit tired looking but were overall clean including the bathroom.  I had a small kitchenette that was fully stocked with cups, forks, kettle etc.  There is also a small fridge in this area, so it is very convenient to have a few snacks or make a cup of tea.  The bed was very comfortable and clean.  Every day the room was made up and very tidy.  The complementary breakfast was terrific with a wide array of good quality food choices:  coffee (Seattle\\'s Best), Tazo teas, juices, hard boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, waffles, bacon or sausages, toast, english muffins, yogurt it goest on. Since my last visit a few years ago, the breakfast area has been renovated and is brighter and more modern.  There are a few drawbacks.  There is no elevator to the second floor and sometimes lugging stuff up was a pain, I did not use the gym but one of my colleagues said that it is fairly limited in terms of what equipment they had.  There was also an odd smell in the room that I had that seemed to go away after a few days.

The pool was supposedly in the same building as well but closed at 10 pm so we didn\\'t get to see it.\\n\\nBiggest complaint was the thin windows which allowed the hwy noise to be heard all the time. \\n\\nReception did ask how our stay was, I mentioned how noisy it was, she apologized and mentioned they are planning renovations to install better windows. So perhaps soon this will no longer be a problem. She asked if we\\'d called and requested a different room.  If we hadn\\'t gotten in so late and noticed the noise before unpacking and getting our kids ready for bed, we might have asked if a different room was available, but I also assume if we are put in a less desirable room, it must be the best option available. I guess I am wrong.\\n\\nMy advice - if you just need a night\\'s lodging and this is a convenient location, ask for an inside room away from the hwy.  From the looks of Abbotsford, this may be the best hotel in the area.",3,negative

Yes, it has the 4 queen-sized beds, but hardly room to turn around in.

We are from a small remote community so are not used to being in the &quot;city&quot;.  I chose this particular property because I already knew how to find it and that it would be easy to commute back and forth. As it turned out, this location was also the sponsor hotel so had a special group rate.\\nI contacted the hotel directly to book because my colleague had a special location request (due to being a smoker and wanting easy outdoor access). At the same time I told them that my room did not have to be in the same location. When I received my confirmation, eventually after having to remind them, I noticed that they only had us on the group rate for part of the stay. Eventually that got straightened out. \\nWhen we checked in, they had given us both easy access rooms. Very convenient but no view at all. Not that there would be a view anyway, I guess. It is the city, after all. Plus, we were there to work and would be putting in long days.\\nThe first night, after 11 hours on our feet, we decided to head a couple doors down to the end of the hall to use the hot tub. We actually seemed to be the only ones using that hallway of the hotel and never saw anyone coming or going to the pool/fitness. We were just starting to unwind, nt even talking because we were so tired, when the security guard came by. At that moment I happened to look up and see a clock. It said 11:00pm (the pool area closes at 10). I looked at the guard, looked at the clock again, and then said to the guard - &quot;That clock can\\'t be right!&quot; He said &quot;Yes it is - GET OUT!\\u201d Feeling chastised, we obediently got out. Went back to our own rooms, I had a shower, washed my bathing suit, poured a glass of wine and looked at the time again - 10:10pm! That made me so mad because there\\'s no way it was even 10:00pm when he\\'d so rudely kicked us out!. \\nOUR OTHER ISSUE was the quality of housekeeping for guests staying over. We were there for 5 nights and neither of us got a sheet change (usually standard after 3 days). One evening I came home and my bed was actually funny with the blanket almost perfectly cornerwise and the pillows still propped up in a bunch exactly as I\\'d left them for watching TV that morning. Every evening when I crawled into bed the sheets were still wrinkled the way I\\'d crawled out. Used glasses were not picked up - just other ones added. One morning I was not quite ready to leave the room at 9:10am when she came barging in past me when I opened the door and started picking up garbage etc. All quite strange!\\nThis hotel offers complimentary continental breakfast. It was fine except that after 5 days was a bit boring. The attached chain restaurant served decent enough food too, which we used several times.\\nAll-in-all I would say this is a perfectly acceptable place to spend 2 or 3 days but you wouldn\\u2019t want to be there much longer. \\nAnother note: As close to the Trans Canada as it was, our rooms were surprisingly quiet.\\nYet another note: Upon departure they actually phoned to tell me I\\'d left my spare glasses in the room. THAT WAS EXCELLENT SERVICE!",4,positive

Being that **AC/DC was in town, (September 22, 2015. I hope this &quot;makes sense&quot; now), we didn\\'t realize that all the hotels would have no vacancy. Come midnight, the Poco Inn &amp; Suites had one room left- for approximately $300. Being exhausted we decided to take that option (as over priced as it was for a standard room). Check in was quick, and we got into our room. The mirrors all had smudges, and when I got into the shower I noticed blood stains on the shower curtain. At that time we took a better look around the bathroom and found blood droplets on the toilet, wall, floor, counter and tub edge. Disgusting to say the least! We pulled back the sheets (since we found blood in the bathroom, who knows what was lurking in the bed) which looked like they had been slept in. So naturally, we called the front desk who sent a manager up to investigate. Instead of any type of apology, or credit/discount towards a future stay, the manager simply stated that we could leave without being charged the room, as there were no other rooms available. That was it. Horrible customer service. We took that option, checked out and left the hotel by approximately 1 am.

We decided to jump on the ferry from Nanaimo to Vancouver that night. Unbeknownst to us there was an AC/DC concert happening and hotel rooms were hard to find. Luckily, we found vacancy in Port Coquitlam. Getting the keys to the room was a breeze, even as late as it was after the 7pm ferry from Vancouver Island due to a cancellation. Unfortunately, when we got in the room we found it to be unsanitary with blood in multiple areas. Blood was on the floor, the shower curtain, the toilet, the wall, and the tub edge. Due to the uncleanliness of the bathroom we investigated the rest of the room and found that the bed looked as if it had been slept in versus properly cleaned and turned over for new guests to enjoy. As well, an easy indication that the room wasn\\u2019t cleaned was the fact that every mirror had spots/smudges on them. When we contacted the manager he came to investigate and still didn\\'t believe that the bed wasn\\'t turned over and wasn\\'t taking any responsibility for it. Moreover, he didn\\'t apologize for the disgustingly unsanitary state of the rest of the room. At that point we just wanted to leave and he only offered to not charge us for the room. Due to the time of day (close to midnight now), and the overpriced/limited number of hotels around we ended up sleeping in the truck. Even to this day, Poco Inn and Suites hasn\\u2019t apologized for the poor accommodation and through various means they even failed at attempting to gain valuable information from us, their guests. Rather, not once but twice they deflected the criticism and accused us of changing our story. I am hoping this isn\\'t a common theme with this Hotel but in my experience they seem to blame or finds excuses when criticized. \\n\\nIt is unfortunate that it came to this because I very rarely, if ever, post reviews yet, here I am. The reason is due to the above and the failure of Poco Inn and Suites to take accountability for their actions or in this case, inactions.

I would have apologized profusely right from the start while the customer was still in Port Coquitlam, BC and offered up alternatives. Those alternatives could have included searching and paying for a hotel room at another hotel since the bloody room was the only vacant one available at this location. Moreover, I would have considered the customers other means of criticism to  to be legitimate until proven otherwise. Lastly, I would have done everything in my power to resolve the issue with the simple information stated above (ex. Room #, invoice #, arrival date and departure date) regardless of the reason for the customer being in town (ex. Concert, hockey, family etc.).

The room was a hodge-podge of tacky decor and amateurish theme decorating. The furniture was a mixture of ubiquitous motel furniture and accessories, (such as a large sofa chair, curtains and bed spread in a typical nondescript pattern/design), and tiki-styled love seat (with a flimsy pool cushion, I&quot;m sure was purchased at Walmart), matching TV stand and nautical decor on the walls. In keeping with the Deserted Island theme, the bed was actually a row boat, which was innovative; the soaker tub was surrounded by fake stones and a cracked mirror. And the ceiling was hand painted to look like a sky - executed by someone who clearly had no artistic talent. But what was even more disappointing was the dust on the plastic palm tree in the corner, dust on all the nautical wall sconces, and the ship\\'s wheel above the bed. Plastic plants are dust collectors. Surely motel staff should know this. Trash it. The dust on everything else was clearly just negligence. Two complimentary bottles of water were in the room at check-in -- a nice touch, but at the listed price of $399 CAD plus tax per night, maybe throwing in chocolates or a tiny island-themed treat would have made a difference. I doubt it though. The motel has two other themed rooms, Romeo &amp; Juliet and Back to the 50\\'s, which we did not check out. Don\\'t let the photos fool you. The room was pretty drab and some items were swapped out. \\nIf you are considering a themed room, take a pass. The regular guest rooms are much nicer and cheaper.",2,negative

Yes, the food was good. \\nBut....\\nif you want to eat there, you have to hike a block outside, to the onsite restaurant, which itself is semi-connected but not sheltered.\\n And if you want to eat at the bar (again - start hiking in the opposite direction), they have to run your food 2 blocks (outside) to get it to you. Even the attendant admitted if you really want to eat a hot plate, don\\'t order anything in the bar.\\n\\n Same issue for the ice machine (start walking -- in the other direction again -- for a block); and. forget a Business Center -- it doesn\\'t exist! This is a real pain if your purpose is business. This is one aspect of a hotel that is indispensable if you need to prepare documents. If you need to print something, Email it to the desk (yeah -- sure!). I would rather they had ripped out the ice machine and put in a fax and printing area. \\n\\nAll in all, unless you are in the main building, it had better be summer and you had better be willing to put up with these quirks.

Reasonable price, great location, great amenities!  It didn\\'t disappoint!  The room was bigger than we expected with plenty of room to set up my son\\'s portable crib.

My kids even ate breakfast out there one morning.\\n\\nThere were a few down sides, although not enough to keep us from staying again.  There was only one air conditioning unit in the suite and it was located in the bedroom.  It cooled the places decently while the bedroom door was open but after the kids went to bed the main area got really hot.  I woke up the first night sweating like crazy!  Since it was cool outside I tried opening the window, but the windows on the front don\\'t open!  The only option for cooler air was the front door but it had no bug screen, plus I didn\\u2019t want the front door left open in the middle of the night.  The ceiling fan helped a little thankfully.  The bathroom drain had no cover on it so I was constantly worried about losing things down the open hole.

I still found dog hair when we stayed for our two nights and it stuck to the bottom of our socks and was visible along the borders of the hallways etc. Not a huge deal but would have been nice if the room had been totally cleaned of the dog hair. The only other issue was with the swamp cooler. It had not been attached properly to the outside vent (unbeknownst to me) and while we were gone for the day we came back to a room that was sweltering hot (it was 33 degrees that day) and the swamp cooler hose had come away from the wall and all the heat had poured into our room all day. I did call the front desk right away to let them know and the lady came over and ended up having to tuck the window curtain in the vent to keep the hose from falling out.

Rooms were very well appointed, fridge, in room climate controls, 32&quot; LG TV and extensive cable selections. Comfortable beds and nice sheets. Marble topped bathroom counters, modern cabinetry and AWESOME water pressure in the shower!\\n\\nNow...for the &quot;less-good&quot; part...\\nChecking in - one fantastic, upbeat, helpful, informative woman on the left - dower, cryptic, less helpful GM on the right.

Wished I waited...and gone left.\\n\\nFIASCO - Sunday morning breakfast! Thanksgiving weekend...at least three hockey teams (and rumour has it a wedding party) booked for between two and three nights.

I physically had to go get the server to have her take our kids orders. \\n\\nIn total it was 50 minutes before food arrived - can you imagine how frustrating it was to see your child and a dozen friends (having all just played a hockey game) sit waiting for food for nearly any hour? In our case - we were the first to order - and the last to receive our meal. 15 minutes AFTER the last order came out.\\n\\nI very much appreciated the significant efforts of the office manager who came to the rescue of the two servers (yes another one gratefully leapt into the fray) made in pouring volumes of coffee, getting water and even taking orders. Yes, she was incredibly apologetic and our breakfast was comped (YES - I tipped 20% on what we ordered) - however it was simply not enough. That breakfast coloured the experience of 40+ future hotel-staying patrons in in such a negative way - all for a lack of a third server and some planning on management\\'s part. Not fair to the servers, not fair to the expediter, not fair to the kitchen crew - and certainly not fair to hotel guests. \\n\\nWould I stay there again?

It was decorated in a plain, modern style with a huge mirror and, unlike every chain hotel we stayed at in Canada, the lighting was truly excellent. There was plenty of space for clothes, both hanging and in drawers, and a big flat-screen television.

Assigned the task of finding a reasonably priced place to stay before and after our trip down Barkley Sound to Bamfield on the working boat, HMS Francis Barkley, I did my internet research and was impressed with all of the positive feedback.  Having stayed at motels a few times and vowing to avoid it again if at all possible, it was quite a surprise to read such great things about the Somass Motel.  I bought in and booked our stay.  We ended up staying there twice because it was such a great experience.  This motel is like no other motel I have ever seen or heard of.  I was blown away!  As we drove up the first thing to stand out was how great to place looked.  New roofs, fresh paint, really nice landscaping....not at all like any motel I have ever seen.  Then, even more surprising were the interiors.  Beautiful!  The rooms were completely redone with perfect bathrooms.  All white, new tubs, showers, sinks. flooring and paint.  Everything was spotless!  The beds are wonderful.  Much like a very good hotel. Marriott comes to mind and I have a very high view of Marriott.  Nice sheets with good looking  bedspreads and beautiful fluffy pillows.  I was truly blown away.  There was a regular coffee maker and also a gourmet pod coffee maker in our first room, (#10) though just the regular coffee maker in our second room, (#15).  The rooms both have small refrigerators and microwave ovens, flat panel tv\\'s and clean new carpeting.  #10 was the first one we stayed in and it included wonderful white terry cloth robes, again much like a very good hotel.  When we came back and were lucky to score a room again for a few nights we did not find robes in #15.  No problem, our gracious hosts provided them as a courtesy.  It is good to note that not all rooms come with the robes and pod coffee makers and we did not know so if you want these things you might want to mention it.  I would have been very happy without them but after having the robe on the first visit I was a bit hooked and glad they were able to come up with one for me again.  The outside of each unit has very comfortable chairs and a table and for the larger cabins there are picnic tables.  The flower beds were filled with flowers and the grounds were very clean.  In one area fo the grounds there is a little grotto surrounded by trees and flowers with tables and chairs for a group of people to sit.  I played my banjo out there and it was magic.  There are few BBQ\\'s on the premisses though no one we saw used one while we were there and there is a pool though we were there off season so it was not full and too cold to swim.  The pool area looked good though and I am sure it is great at the height of summer.  Here is the biggest deal about the Somass...the service is truly amazing.  I know a lot about the hotel business and seriously, these wonderful people for sure know the meaning of hospitality.  They were so outstanding I do not know where to begin.  Okay, maybe I do.  The first think they did was completely map for us how to get to where we needed to go to catch our superfine working boat.  They figured out where we could safely park our pretty high end luxury car for four days while we took off down Barkley Sound.  When they saw there were two of us, out of nowhere one of them appeared at our door with a second robe for my partner and some bath salts for me.  Some of my outfits needed a bit of pressing and when we asked if there was an iron we could use, an iron and ironing board were delivered to our room within 15 minutes.  This couple is warm, professional and savvy.  They also hold the key to truly great hospitality and that is the gift of anticipation.  Housekeeping was very good also.  In fact, we stayed at three places during our 11 days on Vancouver Island and though one was a hotel on the harbor in Victoria, the housekeeping was by far the best at the Somass Motel.

Day and night the owner is out watching everyone, so you are under good scrutiny. He\\'s making good effort to keep the furnishings in good order and the units clean. I have trouble with his idea of \\'kitchen suites\\', which actually is just a kitchen sink , a gas stove and a fridge on one side of the sitting room. No vent. How can you use a gas stove in an enclosed space? Especially, when you can\\'t open the windows for the stench of industrial wood cooking would make you sick. (See our experience with Port Alberni)\\nThe \\'kitchen suite\\' is two rooms. Small sitting area as described above and a small bedroom in the back. For all of this area there is only a 5000 BTU A/C in the \\'kitchen\\' side window. Woefully inadequate. We were there last week of June. It was hot. Couldn\\'t open the windows and it was cool, but just in front of the A/C. Couldn\\'t stand there all night. Not a pleasant experience in an otherwise well looked after place.\\nOutside, the owner has converted every bit of space into a parking spot. Parking spaces are assigned but you have to be a very skilled driver to get in and out of awkward and tight spaces.\\nAlso the place is just of the main highway in that area, so traffic noise is an issue too, esp for the units in the front half of the property.\\nThe owner himself is a friendly person, willing to chat.

The son, who appeared (in my opinion) to party as his job, swore at my partner when she brought the state of our room to the attention of his Mother. He later made a point of parading by naked in an attempt to shock my partner.\\n\\nThe room was dirty. The equipment old and Gerry-rigged together. For instance, a knife in the kitchen was taped together with electrical tape. The tub painted, and the whole place a collection of poor repairs and mismatched, old furniture and equipment. The bed was well used, but comfortable and sleep in the back bedroom fairly restful.\\n\\nThe smoke detector was disabled, without a battery, &quot;they are often stolen&quot; said the owner. She was reluctant to replace it. The door had been forced in at some point, breaking the safety chain. The male owner fixed it when he got home. The  non-smoking policy is not in forced\\n.\\n\\nIn another incident, an electric kettle that we Brought, that just happened to match the units, went missing. The owner claimed not to have had keys.

We had a parking spot right outside and a kitchenette stocked with all the utensils we\\'d need (if we had cooked there; we only used the fridge to keep our water bottles cold for the next day). There were no bugs, lots of towels, comfy beds and pillows.  I would stay there again as it was perfect price and needs wise for our 2 night stay.  Don\\'t go expecting a Holiday Inn or even a Super 8; remember  roadside Motels in the 70\\'s on driving vacations with your parents? Well this is it. When we got home from a day of hiking and chillaxed in the cool,  we had a picnic on the futon, watched DeGrasse make Canada proud in the Olympics and went to sleep happy and comfortable.",3,negative

The decor was a little outdated however the place was extremely clean and we cooked both nights here. The bed was very comfortable , there was no noise in the night and we slept very well.

Figured as long as it was clean, the beds were comfortable, and there was AC, everything else would be fine.\\n\\nWell... it was relatively clean, but the linens and carpets are so old that it is actually really hard to tell if it\\'s clean or just super worn out. The beds though, that was the worst part. Perhaps mattresses in other rooms were better, but those in our room were terrible (we were in the room immediately to the left of the office if you\\'re looking at the motel from the parking lot). The queen size was lumpier than you can imagine and the small single bed was practically falling apart. I wasn\\'t able to sleep together with my partner in either bed. The air conditioner (which is a small unit in the living room window) was super old and make a horrible loud sound, so asked manager to fix, and he replaced it with yet an equally old unit. Neither cooled the room even remotely. 2nd day the unit was again making the loud clanking sound again, so the manager replaced it with a new AC unit (I\\'ll give him props for that), but still... too small of a unit to do any good, it didn\\'t cool anything in the summer heat. Also he gave us a horrible dirty look when he asked if we had run the AC unit all night. &quot;Why yes, of course we did! It\\'s the middle of July!!!&quot; Anyway...\\n\\nThe kitchen was stocked enough with dishes, that was nice, however there is a note above the sink that advises that the guest is responsible for cleaning the kitchen rather than management. Kind of odd considering I figure that is what we pay for when we check in somewhere? I\\'d rather know that my dishes were cleaned properly by staff (hopefully?) than by some previous guest when I went to use them. So this meant cleaning dishes before and after. Not something I want to do on my vacation weekend.\\n\\nFinally, although the motel was NOT busy at all... we asked if we could check out a few hours later on the 2nd day (we checked in at around 8pm on the 1st night) as we would be out diving on the Sunday and wished to shower and pack upon our return, rather than take all of our luggage with us to China Creek, the manager said no but we were welcome to pay an extremely high hourly rate or for an entire full day. That was crazy and not an insane request that couldn\\'t have been accommodated.\\n\\nIn closing, it\\'s true... the back windows look out onto a trailer park. I had quite the surprise on Sunday morning when a fellow was sitting on his deck of his trailer (quite close by in fact) and I\\'m sure he could hear every word of all the conversations held between my partner and I all weekend.",2,negative

I cannot comment on the lodge as a B&amp;B because we had the whole place and made all our own meals. The lodge itself looks like it needs some extensive maintenance. Leaky faucets, running toilets, loose fixtures, burned out lights and a very worn floor in the main room all made it feel ... rustic. The house needed a really good clean too. Oddly, the kitchen also lacked some basics such as a can opener, mixing bowls, and baking trays. \\n\\nNegatives aside, it was really a great place. The large main room easily housed all 25+ people present. The fireplace was gorgeous. The property is simple and large (about 5 acres) and backs onto a river with good fishing. The current was a bit too fast for the kids to swim in the river, but Sproat lake was only about 15 inutes away. The rooms themselves ranged in size from very large, to average sized. Most had an ensuite bathroom. There were also 3 \\'public\\' toilets in the common areas. The layout of the house is basically 2 wings off the central great room. The larger wing had 4 rooms upstairs and 4 downstairs. The lower rooms had large doors opening onto decks with comfy couches and chairs. The smaller wing had one very large room downstairs with a foozeball table and full sectional couch and TV. Upstairs was 2 more large rooms and private living quarters. The upstairs rooms in this wing share a common bathroom. A small den joining the second wing to the main room completes the house. The rooms varied from having one king or queensize bed to having a double and twin, twin bunks plus a single twin, and twin over double bunk plus a twin. There were also cots available for set up in some rooms. I think the upstairs ensuites had a shower stall and the downstairs had a tub. \\n\\nBottom line, this is a great space for a large gathering.

I had no experience of the town and no idea where to stay, but I saw their sign, thought it looked promising, and drove in. Fortunately there was a room available, and the owners could not have been kinder or more considerate to a rather rattled and road-weary person who appeared alone out of the night. They suggested a quiet place where I could have some supper, and truly made me feel like a guest in their home.\\nThe Lodge is exquisitely furnished, and immaculately clean. My room was spacious and quiet, with a most welcome and relaxing jetted bathtub, and a very comfortable bed. It\\'s located on a beautiful property, surrounded by gardens, and is secluded and quiet, with a sense of peace and sanctuary. The breakfast was delicious and hearty.

Which meant, &quot;Don&quot;t try to enter.&quot; There were no facilities for making an evening cup of tea or coffee.\\nBreakfast was continental which was unusual for our recent bed and breakfast stays but it was quite varied. We sat down for our first cup of coffee and one of the hosts came to speak to us and started complaining about US politics, Canadian healthcare and US healthcare. She couldn\\'t be stopped. Now, this was ok with a couple of people there, but my husband and I do not discuss politics with strangers and certainly not when we want a peaceful breakfast. I left the area without breakfast, came back after 10 minutes and she was still there talking on the same topic. Later on, she changed to talking about her ailments when her husband arrived and started right back talking politics again. I left with a piece of bread.

data/ca/181778/609758/230797541.html,Cedar Wood Lodge Bed &amp; Breakfast Inn &amp; Conference Center,"""To be fair, we did not really choose Cedar Wood Lodge.  Instead it was offered as a package deal with a local fishing charter outfit in town called Slivers.  They said it was a great deal.  Instead it was the most expensive of our trip and honestly the least desirable of all our accommodations during this vacation and certainly not our style.  \\n\\nFirst the positive: Grounds are well manicured with shady spots to sit and the inside is clean with a nice pool table.  Plenty of off street parking with shade.  They also offer a secure room to store your baggage if you need to check out but are not leaving town and don\\'t want to leave valuables in a car parked publicly.  Free wi-fi.  Sufficient packed brown bag breakfast for the early morning fishing people.\\n\\nNow the neutral and cons: our room was on the south side (3 rooms face south) with only one window which faces a major roadway that has significant road noise until about midnight and then starting again at 4a-5am.  We slept terribly but we can\\'t stand not having some fresh air.    When we checked in the owners told us the place was specifically built to be a bed &amp; breakfast.  Unfortunately, the location is not good with all the road noise and not convenient to walk to restaurants or other sites.  The north side of the house would be the most desirable to sleep since that is least exposed to the main road, but of course the owners living quarters are there.  Another downside for some people (not me) is that coffee (caffeine products) are not offered in the morning; however, they do tell you where in town it can be obtained early.  Although they did not explain why, the reason is obvious from their particular religious persuasion which you can figure out from family pictures on the walls, or if you open the night stand dresser in your room and see the book title.  Overall, the place feels like a small hotel with 8 numbered rooms and the place more focused on volume while we would prefer a smaller more personable place.  We also do not like supporting establishments that in turn that are of certain persuasions that breed like rabbits.  Exponential population growth inevitably leads to environmental degradation and population crashes but this blind faith ignores reality, although they are certainly not the only faith with this characteristic.  From reading the reviews, for some this place is fine, for others like us, it is not a good fit.",3,negative

I\\'m so glad that we stayed here. Staying on the tug and having dinner, also on the tug was unbelievable. Bouchara\\'s Moroccan dinners were to &quot;kill for&quot; and during the cooking process, the &quot;smells&quot; of the spices could not prepare you for the actual dinner itself. Dan had a part in the desert course and the cheesake and flaky crust of his pie was ....as we say in Hawaii.....ONO (Good)....Having dinner with a group of people you\\'ve never met was the other fun part of dinner. You were mixed in with people visiting from the island, or were local, and from different countries of the world. Dinner talk was fun, as you talked about their homes, families, travels, etc. What better way to have a dinner. But what made all this possible was the hosts: Dan &amp; Bouchara. They made you feel at home, right off the bat. Meeting both of them, made you feel like you\\'ve know them forever. I HIGHLY recommend not only eating their exquisite dinners but also staying there. You have the best of both; Remember to make reservations for dinner, Bouchara\\'s &amp; Dan\\'s dinner are so popular, you\\'ll need to book in advance.

When we first came aboard, there was a dinner party going on, and we weren\\'t quite sure if we were in the right place.

We did not get a chance to see the other rooms but I think they were nicer and larger and had their own bathrooms.  Our view was onto a deck, through two portholes which we had kept open because otherwise the room became stuffy.  Anybody walking along could look right into our room so there wasn\\'t much privacy.  In the morning we were awakened by noises because the room was right next to the kitchen, and the early-rising guests were carrying on a loud conversation.\\n   Most of the reviews are about the good food, but we did not eat dinner.  The breakfast was unusual, with spicy sweet potatoes, which would be good if you liked hot spicy foods in the morning. \\n  The owners were very busy with the dinner when we arrived so we didn\\'t get a chance to talk with them until the next morning.

Yes, it\\u2019s peak season but the price was too high given what we received in return.

Unfortunately that was literally right outside our room. What a stupid setup. Move it further from the side of the hotel!!!

It was very spacious and the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed - and we cooked for 12 one night and 10 on another.  The BBQ was clean and worked well (and got good use!)

data/ca/181779/1016093/137485247.html,Oceanside Village Resort,"""We stayed here 3 nights over August long weekend.  We shared a 3 bedroom loft cabin with another family \\u2013 4 adults, 4 kids between 2 and 6 years.  Overall, the cabin itself was great and just what we were looking for.  But that is all you get - if you are looking for service, amenities, etc., you\\u2019re looking in the wrong place.\\n\\nResort \\u2013 we were in Phase II where there are about 70 cabins.  Phase I has about 200 cabins and is closer to the plaza with the swimming pool, office, shops and restaurants.  The cabins are oriented in a grid like city blocks.  Each one sits on a small lot about 25 x 70 ft with minimal privacy between cabins.  Many of the cabins are \\u201cowned\\u201d and look like they have residents that live there for the whole summer.  Indoor swimming pool was a nice facility.  Clean, on newer side, decent size with decent showers, etc.  The walk from Phase II to the pool was probably 3-4 blocks.  The place is pleasant but definately has an \\u201cupscale trailer home complex\\u201d feel rather than a \\u201ccabin in the woods\\u201d feel.\\n\\nCabin \\u2013 Cabin was great and this is what you are really paying for. The 3 BR was probably about 1200 SF and was perfect for our two families.  It might be a little compact for 8 adults.  Furnishings and finishes were nice \\u2013 exactly like pictures.  Quality of the appliances and cooking utensils were also good.  You could also expand the bar table to seat 8 people.  Spacious deck in the back with a high quality gas grill we used every night.  Only thing I found uncomfortable was the privacy on the back decks \\u2013 you are 10-20 feet from 5 other decks with very little in between.  There is a 1 car gravel parking in front - we parked second car in front of the cabin parallel to road (stuck out a little but no one complained).\\n\\nService \\u2013 this is fully selfserve.  You get your keys from the office and then you are on your own.  Take out your own garbage.  Dishes need to be in the dishwasher, bed sheets and towels need to be placed in the bath tub, gas grill needs to be cleaned before you leave otherwise you risk a cleaning fee.  I believe you can purchase maid service during your stay if desired.  Similarly at the pool \\u2013 not monitored, you use your key to get in an out as required and bring your own towels.\\nLocation \\u2013 Expect to drive to the beach or at least ride your bikes.  This was our first time to Parkville so wasn\\u2019t sure what to expect.  What we found was that it was not at all convenient to walk to the beach from the resort. There is no public access to the beach through the resorts on the other side of the road.  To get to the beach, you have to hike up to the Provincial park entrance and take the park road into the beach.  It\\u2019s probably a 2 km walk so, after the first day, we drove there.  Even during long weekend, there was plenty of parking and there is a restroom with flush toilets in the park so not really a problem.  Unless you are at a beach front resort \\u2013 it probably doesn\\u2019t matter if you are 0.5 or 3 km away.  You probably still end up driving to the beach.\\n\\nParksville \\u2013 Rathtrevor beach is huge.  It\\u2019s not so much a beach like Kitsilano or Spanish Banks in Vancouver.  This is only a thin strip of dry sand with a huge tidal flat.  Permanently wet, dark, soft sand ocean bed with large tidal pools all around.  There is definitely a fishy smell, especially when you dig in the wet sand, but it did not bother us.  The days we were there, the water was out from 10am until 4pm and the water must have been 2 km from the beach edge.  Almost all families with younger children doing things like building sand castles (bring a heavy duty shovel for the compact sand), skim boarding, kite flying, catching small crabs for fun or just relaxing.  No shade so bring an umbrella or lots of sunblock.\\n\\nWe only went to Parkville community beach once.  They had the largest playground I have ever seen with a zip line, 12 person teeter totters, a water park and a whole bunch of other interesting apparatus.  Definitely worth a visit if you have kids 12 or under.\\n\\nWe would visit Parksville again and, while I would certainly recommend Oceanside as a rental cabin, we will probably try out a different place since there was nothing really special about the resort.",4,positive

The one star rating is for the cleaners who did a wonderful job.\\n\\nWe had to move to a new cottage half-way through our four night stay because the on-line reservation system doesn\\u2019t work.  We were told we had to be out at 11am like everyone else and come back several hours later to check-in again.  No courtesy was given (even when we asked for it) to minimize the disruption to our holiday and we had to insist arrangements be made to move food between fridges. \\n \\nBoth cottages had worn-out sheets, and dirty old pillows.  The second cottage backed onto the highway which was very noisy. The ceiling fan looked and sounded like it would come out of its bolts at any moment, and the dishwasher leaked - we informed the front office and nothing was done.  WI-FI service is terrible and didn\\'t work at all in the second cottage, even when I went outside (other guests also had trouble in other parts of the resort).  The screeching sprinkler system starts at 1am, so if you\\'re a light sleeper, this will be a problem.  The property is not close to the beach - about a 15 to 20 minute walk, unless you want to try sneaking through other resorts across the street.  \\n \\nThe manager was given an opportunity to address our problems and make things right, but didn\\'t do anything.  In fact, the manager said I had no right to complain because I knew about having to move cottages, dismissed the fan and mechanical problems, and blamed me for not being able to access WI-FI.  Completely unacceptable, and it\\u2019s hard to believe we paid $250 a night for this.",1,negative

Usually when you view a rental online the pictures are quite impressive, but not accurate of what you get.  Not Morning Glory!  From the moment we walked in  we felt welcomed and made ourselves at home.   I got the (gas) fireplace going to warm up dad, who we like to take on little adventures, and  got us all unpacked and settled in.  The complimentary bottle of wine was a lovely added touch, as were the bath robes.  Two floors gave our son, who joined us,  a little privacy and the sofa bed he slept on upstairs was so comfortable he said he slept from the time his head hit the pillow until he woke up in the morning.  Having a second bathroom with shower was also a bonus as there were four of us.  Washer and dryer was also a nice surprise, , as  it was nice  to  launder  the bedding and towels before we left.  The dishwasher was also a pleasant surprise but we hardly used it during our stay.  Only complaint was the coffee pot was not cleaned by the previous tenant, nor did they dump their coffee grinds, bus as the policy is quite clear, I basically blame the previous tenants for not ensuring everything was left as it was found.  Also several glasses were dirty, one wine glass had a very big water ring, but I am one of those people who do like to wash the dishes, utensils, etc before using any how.  We were close enough to Parksville,  it was a five minute drive  to Lefty\\'s  (review to follow),  and the government  liquor store and shopping centers.   We make  use of our time when in the area by taking a drive to Coombs Market, but sadly the goats were not on the roof during our stay, as they bring them in after Thanksgiving.   Morning Glory, the cottage we stayed at, sleeps 8, however I think for a more comfortable stay 6 people (3 couples) would be better.  There is a tv in master bedroom as well as the loft and the living room, so if you are a late nighter, you can watch t.v. and not disturb any one. A private deck, with patio table,chairs and bbq completed the cottage.  The price?  Unbelievable!  Off season was $120 per night, with a pet fee for our dog.  Even the high season was quite affordable.  Parksville is such a beautiful spot to visit, and we will definitely keep Morning Glory at the top of our list for places to stay.  Almost forgot, there is a swimming pool and a full spa as well as a lovely Japanese Tea house.  Across the street we went to the pub at Beach Acres.

The cottages are very new and have full kitchens with pots, pans, etc, plus a barbecue everything a person would need to cook a nice meal. There are also washer and dryers that come in handy if you are staying there for a while. The beach is about a 15min walk through a provincial park, but if you have a lot of gear I would suggest taking your car, and paying to park. In all I would not stay anywhere else, it is very modern, clean, spacious, and in all will make your vacation a very enjoyable stay. There is nothing negative that I can say about this property which pretty much shows how perfect it is for any vacation.",5,positive

We did the dishes by hand due to time and after three full days of meals we ran through the 3 complimentary dishwasher detergent provided, while I don\\'t think you would leave a full tub of supplies available the supplies should be provided according to length of stay and the number of guests.

While the unit we stayed in was well-equipped, the name &quot;Oceanside Village Resort&quot; is very misleading. The \\'village\\' is actually cheek-by-jowl, yardless, townhouse size units with roads everywhere. The nearest beach is a 15 to 20 minute walk away down a road we know to be busy during the summer season. In addition, many of the so-called \\'oceanside\\' units back onto the main road into Parksville and the traffic noise, even in March, is constant. No ocean\\'s roar, no scent of the sea and no tranquil forest setting here:  and certainly not our idea of the relaxing \\'oceanside\\' experience suggested by the resort\\'s name. \\nAdding to our own unhappy experience, our unit was just steps away from three others, still under construction. Crews worked throughout the day, with loud music, back hoes and ringing saws our constant companions.\\nWhen we informed the on-site manager that we believed we ought to have been told that the unit was in the midst of a construction area during the booking process, she readily agreed. She said that the team had actually discussed this very concern earlier in the day. Despite this fact, she made no offer of any consideration in recognition of our far-from-satisfactory experience. \\nWe suggest those looking for a Rathtrevor beach experience look on the ocean side of \\'Resort Road\\'. Those offerings are actually in forested areas and within walking distance of the beach, which is probably why you want to be in a Rathtrevor setting to begin with. Don\\'t be fooled by the Oceanside name. This isn\\'t an oceanside or even a forest experience. It is a suburban experience near a busy road and far from the famous beach that is drawing you to come to the Parksville area in the first place.",2,negative

However, we didn\\'t want to be one of those complaining guests so we took matters into our own hands and doubled up on pillowcases so that we didn\\'t have to use the stained ones. As a usual practice, we never use duvets at any place that we stay at when travelling because we all know they don\\'t clean the duvets (watch the undercover shows on hotels). So we rolled up the duvet and left it at the foot of the bed and never used it for our entire stay of the 4 nights. When we arrived home, we received an email by Oceanside informing me that they had gone ahead and charged my credit card without authorization for stains on the duvet. I emailed to let them know we did not even use the duvet and noticed stains on the pillow cases to begin with but did not complain about that. They did not reply so I gave them a call and asked for the charge to be reversed. The assistant manager on the phone said she would check with her manager and give me a call back. Instead of the courtesy call, they emailed back saying this is their policy and would not reverse the charge. We travel frequently and have never experienced this anywhere.

Location was a strong attractor for us not only because of close proximity to Rathtrevor but also restaurants and attractions like Wildlife Recovery nearby.

Cable TV was available but we never used it but we were pleased with the speed and signal strength of the free wifi. The bathroom is a good size, very basic with Waltec faucets and fibreglass bath/shower combo unit, countertop and sink were adequate, but more hooks for hanging clothes would have been a plus. The toiletries were minimal and you can ask for a hair dryer at the front desk. Carpets in room were clean and lino in bathroom was in great shape. The door lock/security system is a bit dated with metal keys to open a locking door knob and a deadlock that only locks from the inside.  No safe to secure valuables - at least we could not locate one.  We found the premises very quiet in the evening and the air conditioning worked well.  This site has an elevator which came in handy for one of our party with mobility issues.

We splurged for a 1 BR ocean view room -- expensive on a summer weekend ($400/night including taxes) but we needed a getaway.  If the ocean views are important to you, the extra cost is necessary.  The non-ocean view rooms pretty much overlook the quiet side street leading to the property, the parking, a strip of grass...none of the views are unpleasant (depending on how you feel about parking) but you could just as easily be at a less-expensive property further from the oceanfront.\\n\\nSo back to the unit.  The size was reasonable, with everything a family might want.  Air conditioning was a big plus as that\\'s unusual to find in Parksville.  The kitchen was complete and had a comfortable cork floor and high-end appliances.  There is a full bathroom off the bedroom with  long, deep soaker tub and a separate glass shower big enough for you and three of your closest friends...but only a standard shower head, which was one of the few mid-market touches I saw in this unit.  The toilet is in a separate room within the bathroom (also nice for families).  There is a separate powder room with toilet and sink near the kitchen.\\n\\nStacking washer/dryer, a large storage closet off the hall and a gas fireplace were also nice touches.  There were moderate sized flat screen TVs in the living room and bedroom; there was a DVD player in the bedroom and I think there was one in the LR also.  My teen reported that the sofabed was very comfortable and felt like a &quot;real&quot; bed.\\n\\nThis unit was all about the views.  We booked ocean view and were not disappointed.  The windows are huge and look directly onto the beach, which is steps in front of the two-story building that we were in.  There is a tower behind our building which had privately-owned condos, and looked like part of the same complex.  Only the very top floors on one side would have had an ocean view.\\n\\nWe had a decent-sized balcony with doors leading onto it from both the living room and the bedroom.  It had a round table and four &quot;plastic-wicker&quot; chairs.  I missed the lack of a lounger or footstool outside; the setup was good for meals but not my ideal for reading or sitting to watch the ocean.\\n\\nThe service was a little spotty -- valet was requested to help with our bags on arrival and departure, and both times we were kept waiting for over half an hour.

The rooms were a nice size for a group of five and the size of the master bedroom and ensuite bathroom was perfect for us and our two little ones. The extra studio room also had a kitchenette which was useful, but we were charged extra per night for a third adult, so I expected it to be reasonable.  The main kitchen was well equipped with little cleaning kits (dishwasher tabs, scourer etc) which I thought was a nice touch, I\\'m a sucker for that kind of thing.  The TV reception was very grim (we didn\\'t have a reception at all in the bedroom) but we just looked out the window most of the time anyway.  \\n\\nI used the spa once alone and the other time with my girlfriend.  The service and treatments were completely unflawed. The two ladies there are great at what they do and made us feel completely looked after.  The valet service was timely and very friendly.\\n\\nThe area which left us frustrated and later, a little bemused, was the room service menu which really needs to be addressed in some way.  There was confusion between three different menus (two online, there is no hardcopy guest book) and then also staff disputing with us what was on the children\\'s menu (stating that side dishes were not included, when on the menu it stated they were). The food throughout was very average for the cost, although I am not sure if is is better in the restaurant.\\n\\nLater during check out we had to get them to take off extra charges for bringing the food to our room (on top of the delivery and service charges, thankfully we double checked the receipts).  Not good at all.  Room service may not be an issue for some but we find sometimes that we do have to rely on a hotel\\'s room service for dinners and this was just not up to scratch for what advertises itself as a luxury hotel.  \\n\\nAll in all, an average resort with some beautiful views but for $429 per night there is definite room for improvement.",3,negative

Because it was our anniversary, I chose Beach Club Resort as a getaway for three nights.  We checked in on our anniversary and selected Pacific Prime Steak and Chop for our &quot;romantic&quot; dinner.  My husband ordered the prime rib which was suggested by the waiter and then advised that they were out of prime rib.  He ordered a tbone steak instead thinking it was afterall a steak house.  I ordered chicken.  It took nearly an hour to get our meals.  During that hour, four drunk men at the bar had their own party at the expense of other guests.  The child at the table next to us cried as the four drunk men partied.  Not sure why the parents didn\\'t remove the child from the crazy scene, but they chose to stay and order another beer.  Anyhow, the steak arrived with the wrong side dish and to my husband\\'s disappointment, it tasted like it was freezer burned and peculiar.  I had finished my meal by the time the waiter returned and learned about the peculiar tbone steak and with the noise level escalating, we decided to simply leave and go to our room (421).  The waiter was accommodating and even sent a meal to our room for my husband, but said he could only offer 20percent off the final price of the whole meal and that we should check with the day manager to see if he could just take it off our bill.  Because it was our anniversary and it was already going downhill, we chose to wait until checkout to deal with the dinner.  I felt embarrassed even having to bring up the meal at check out after enjoying so many other aspects of the three days, but I did, thinking if I were in his shoes and a guest had just spent $2000 at my hotel, I would give them their anniversary meal free.  Well, he offered 50% off and I felt humiliated haggling at the front desk.  Upon examination of my bill when I got home, the waiter had not taken 20 percent off and therefore we paid for 70% of the meal meaning $65.11.  I don\\'t even think the total of the meal they have on the bill was correct.  I think we were charged for three meals (two in restaurant and one in room).  All that to say, if you plan on going to Prime Steak House at the BC Resort, it\\'s probably best not to order steak or think it will be intimate and appropriate for a romantic getaway.  I know it is high season and that means lots of families and crying children.  There was no escaping the crying children except in your room with windows closed.  Even sitting on the patio most times was challenging and I had requested a quiet room.  We had one child almost hanging over his balcony watching us the first night.  The other meals at the Prime Steak Restaurant were excellent other than the strange burger (tasteless meat and strange bun), but the service was extremely slow.  Expect an hour wait for a meal.  Room service was excellent.  The spa is tiny, but the services were fabulous.  Thank you Denise.  Will I go back to this hotel?  Yes.  Will I order steak or beef?  No.   I am disappointed that the day manager didn\\'t have sense enough to simply not charge us for our anniversary meal.  We travel all over the world and know what most fine dining restaurants would have done if they were in this situation.  I would go here with a family during high season, but do not go as a couple.  (The sandcastle building competition was on this weekend and it was awesome and only a short walk on the boardwalk - amazing artists).  Also, dress in layers.

Right on the sandy beaches of parksville (which is a wonderful location.) We had breakfast on the deck the next day and it was very delicious. The deck was a good size. \\n\\nCons : the room was slightly small for the price (but that wasn\\'t really a big deal to us). The biggest problem of all was as we checked out that day and were on our way home I realized that I had forgotten my 200$ iPod docking station and an iPod touch that was a gift from a family member in the room. I called the resort about a half hour after leaving to say I would be back to grab my things and the receptionist assured me it would be there waiting. When we returned to the hotel &quot;somehow&quot; the iPod touch was not there. I know that there is absoloutly no way I would forget the iPod dock but grab the iPod itself seeing as how those two objects were rarely apart. I only ever used the iPod touch with the docking station. I searched through my things anyway, not forgetting to look under the seats in my car or in other random compartments. After not finding it I called the resort and spoke with a lady who claimed to be the manager. She told me there is no way one of her staff members would have stolen from me. She did not take my complaint seriously at all and I was made to feel preposterous for even daring to think one of her staff would do this. She was short with me on the phone and very very rude. This was about a year ago and I still have yet to see my iPod touch since that stay.

It was great to be instantly on the beach without having to navigate any cliffs or paths to get there, or have to drive 10 minutes to get to the water!\\n\\nOn to the room: WOW!

The position of the hotel is lovely, right on Parksville Beach and our ground floor room had a terrace where we could relax and watch the sun go down. There is a boardwalk between the hotel and the beach, so don\\'t expect too much privacy as this gets quite busy. Just a personal comment about the hotel design, when looking back at it from along the beach I couldn\\'t help feeling that the hotel is a bit of a blot on the landscape due to the height of the tower (would have looked much better and more in keeping with environment without the tower section). With regard to the room we were not particularly impressed with the standard and quality of amenities. The safe did not work, the TV was small and the kettle/coffee maker were basic to say the least, compared to the other hotels we stayed in on Vancouver Island. We ate in the Pacific Prime restaurant on both nights and have to say that the food was good and the service in the restaurant was excellent. Our main gripe during our stay was the fact that our bedroom was not serviced at all during the second day, despite the fact that we did not leave the \\'Do Not Disturb\\' sign on the door. We had to ask reception for extra coffee and milk and did not get any spare shampoo so had to use our own. We had to tidy the room and make the bed ourselves, something we are well used to at home but not something we expect to do on holiday... especially when we have paid for this service as part of the price! When we checked out of the hotel I mentioned this again to reception, expecting the hotel to maybe at least offer a small discount off our bill. Far from it, they actually seemed more interested in asking me to pay an additional $2 to help &quot;offset my carbon footprint&quot; (I politely refused!). This hotel has a lot of potential, but needs a much higher level of attention to detail in my opinion",3,negative

The hotel is between the highway and the beach and is in a nice location, if a little soulless . \\n\\nOur rooms (studios) were clean and nicely furnished, but very cramped for the price. The restaurant and bar, however, were quite a disappointment. In the late evening, we had drinks and appetizers in the bar.

The use of the word resort is, in my opinion, highly misleading...and I have no clue what the &quot;club&quot; is supposed to represent.\\n\\nThe location is right on the fabulous Parksville beach, which is the principal draw for this town.

There is a 7acre waterfront parcel for sale right next door...maybe someone will buy it and build something more appropriate for this location.\\n\\nA quick timeline review.... Upon arrival, the clerk tried to charge a higher rate than had been quoted when we made the reservation.  No apology offered.  When asked a question about one aspect of the property, the clerk provided an answer that was not helpful, and once we figured out the answer ourselves, he was inaccurate and not helpful.  It was obvious that the front desk staff conversation is scripted, insincere, and smarmy.  Not a good start.\\n\\nThe room was fine...great view of the beach, little patio, kitchenette ( which was superfluous for us)\\nIt would have been nice if there were some comfortable chairs, instead of having only the bed to sit or recline.

It was a nice thing and appreciated. \\n\\nWe ate at the restaurant the first night....Pacific Prime Steak &amp; Chop- check my separate review elsewhere, but in a nutshell, absurdly expensive (especially the wine) considering the unremarkable decor, bad layout, very average staff.

My kids had an amazing time with the beach right out the door. It made for easy beach days where we could make runs back to the room if we needed to .  The beach was beautiful and the ocean was shallow for quite a distance so my young children could splash and wade to their hearts content.  The sunset views from their restaurant were nothing short of spectacular.  We booked at the last minute and there was not a two bedroom suite available so we booked a one bedroom suite and had booked a separate studio for my inlaws but the management were able to accommodate us despite it being fully booked and placed us side by side and opened the connecting door between the rooms so it was a two bedroom suite.  The room was perfect. Immaculately clean and spacious with every amenity you needed. Despite being there for just two days we still loved having a washing machine and dryer for the wet clothes.  Would love to come again and stay longer!",5,positive

We booked a one bedroom ocean view suite on the 7th floor. The apartment had an impressive jaw-dropping panoramic view of the expansive beach from both the bedroom and living room and kitchen area. We were impressed with the generous space, d\\u00e9cor and fully equipped kitchen. However, the noisy balcony was very annoying. Moments after arriving, we opened the sliding door to what appeared to be a very lovely balcony, but were disappointed when we heard distinct rumbling noises coming from the back of the oceanfront restaurant across from us. Some days you could smell what was on the menu which was fine. In light of the fantastic ocean vista, it was disappointing that we couldn\\u2019t chill out, read or have coffee on the patio space. (Also, we were paying top dollar for the apartment). So, we ended up keeping the balcony door closed at all times. We told the Beach Club Resort reception personnel about the issue of the irritating outdoor sounds. Two staff members told us that other guests had complained about the noise factor from the balcony of suite 701. We were shown another unit, which was the same size, but had one fraction of the view (it didn\\u2019t even compare to the ocean view from our apartment).  But with all due respect, it had an extremely quiet balcony. We decided to stick with our killer ocean vista and stay in our original suite. When we checked out, we got $200 off our total bill for the inconvenience. In the future if booking with a large resort complex, I will now ask: \\u201cIn addition to the ocean, what else is the balcony facing? Is it quiet 24-7? Is there a restaurant directly across from the suite?\\u201d The resort definitely had its positives. The beach directly across the boardwalk was pristine and gorgeous. In the mornings when it was low tide, you could walk for miles. In the evenings, when the tide came up, one could swim forever and watch the sunset.  I thought it was a bonus being so close to Rathrevor Beach Provincial Park, which was a fantastic place to bird watch and walk and cycle.",3,negative

Given their prices, I feel compelled to say that I would not call this a luxury resort, exactly, except for the views.  The room was fine, but it was not a &quot;luxury&quot; room.  The amenities in the room were fine, but not the sort of amenities one might expect for over $300 per night for a very small ocean-view room.  However, the pool, though small, is immaculately clean and a very nice temperature.  The hotel is right on the beach.  The beds were clean and very comfortable.  The room was absolutely spotless.  We called down three times with requests - for ice, extra towels, and coffee.  Each time, someone showed up at our door with what we needed, and a smile, in less than five minutes.  The problem we had was the very noisy wedding, complete with drunk people singing loudly (and badly) and cigarette smoke drifting up into our room, right underneath us until well after midnight.  We specifically requested a quiet room.  Next time, I will try to be more specific about what I mean by &quot;quiet.&quot;  :)  I have stayed all over the world at many very nice hotels and was generally impressed.  They apologized for the noise and reduced our bill a little bit ($75.00 off of the final bill).  That was definitely appreciated (though the quiet room we asked for would have been far more appreciated, especially by our small child).

We did not pay the higher rate for the ocean view, but we did end up in an end unit, so we did have a partial view of the water.  Given that it was a Thursday in April, I would consider it the &quot;low season&quot;.  The price was fair, and you get what you pay for, but it was no deal.\\n\\nCheck-in was quick and efficient, although the clerk was oddly unenthusiastic, almost to the point of seeming withdrawn.  It sort of made us wonder what we had done to annoy him.\\n\\nThe room was great.  It had a balcony with a view of the ocean.  We assumed they put us in that room because we hadn\\'t paid for the ocean view and that was the best room that wasn\\'t an ocean view.  Given that the hotel was pretty dead that night (a Thursday in April), you think maybe they could have put us in an ocean view anyway.  But maybe they were worried that it would get around that you can get an ocean view without paying for an ocean view, and then no one would volunteer to pay for an ocean view.  On the other hand, maybe if they had given us an ocean view upgrade for free, they would have earned a 5-out-of-5 rating and word would get around that this was the best place to stay in Parksville.\\n\\nWe enjoyed the Wi-Fi, which was included in the cost of the room (as was shampoo and towels).  We also enjoyed the indoor pool/hot tub.  The pool isn\\'t huge, but it was large enough and there were only a couple people there.\\n\\nThe Beach Club Resort was a very nice place to stay.  It looks brand new from the outside.  While it wasn\\'t perfect in every way (which would have earned it a 5-out-of-5), it was still pretty good.

The Beach Club garnered 7 strikes in two days stay. Let me enumerate:\\n\\n1. Our first night was a gift from family that included chilled Champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries (my wife and I were on our honeymoon.) They put it in the wrong room.\\n2. We left the room around 10:15am and put the door hanger out for them to clean it. It was never cleaned.\\n3-5 Since it wasn\\'t cleaned we called the front desk and asked for towels, etc. We were promised they would be supplied right away. This was around 1PM. We called again at 2PM and were promised towels as we left the room. We returned about 4PM - no towels. We called again at 6PM - apologies from the front desk. At 8PM I\\'d had enough and made a final call to the front desk in a tone that they understood as very displeased. Towels and soap, etc, showed up within minutes with apologies. Unacceptable!\\n6, 7 and 8: They rekeyed our room key while we were out for some reason and when we returned we could not get into the parking garage or our room. As I had a broken ankle, my wife kindly walked down to the front desk and had the keys re-encoded (or so we thought.) She walked all the way back to the room (it\\'s a bit of a hike) only to find the keys did not work. (We were told later that the staff was aware that one of their key-encoders was on the fritz) So another hike to the front desk and then personnelle accompanied my wife this time to allow us into our room. This took about a half hour while I waited. They sent maintenance right away to re-program the lock but that was apparently not the problem so off they went again to get our keys fixed (third attempt) which worked. Altogether this wasted a significant amount of time.\\nStrike #9 We then went down to the pool thinking we could relax a bit. No guest towels in the pool area. I had to shlep to the front desk and wait to ask for towels. About 15 minutes later maintenance showed up to see if there were actually no towels. Of course, there were none. Then, (while we wait) about another 15 minutes later, the same gentleman shows up with towels ...Finally. Needless to say, that wasted more time we could have used enjoying this beautiful facility.\\nThe pool and hot tub area were clean however they wreaked of chlorine so strong that we had to shorten our stay. We\\'re not particularly fussy about such things but it was overly strong.\\n\\nSo I don\\'t know what happened here. A resort like this should be top-notch and it could be. They simply need to sharpen up and pay attention to detail. One call is all it should take to take care of any guest need. They fell woefully short in this area.\\n\\nAs for the property itself - WOW. The accommodations are stellar, clean and well-maintained. The view from our suite was outstanding.

Nice balcony, en-suite, washer/dryer and even a second bathroom (powder room). Beautiful beach and boardwalk are right in front of the resort with easy access.

Luckily they were able to upgrade us to an &quot;ocean front suite&quot; which was spectacular. If you are looking for a view make sure you book accordingly. Even bigger caution - we noticed some suites in the resort which were facing directly onto the roof with zero view.

If we ever stay there again, we would either just get food to make our own meals or order from somewhere in town (I hear there\\'s a great Indian place just down the street).\\n\\nThe king bed was quite comfortable.

Kudos on hiring some of the most genuinely friendly hotel staff ever, from the front desk staff to the maintenance guy (with a special thank you to the lovely Angel in the dining room who handled our gaggle of kids with a smile).\\n\\nIndoor pool: Nicely equipped with kids\\' floaties, etc. and a genuinely hot jacuzzi tub. Did I enjoy lounging by the pool while the kids splashed, watching seagulls on the beach a few feet away? Why, yes I did! \\n\\nThe Breakfast and Stay package was a great deal. Kids\\' meals are extra, but a steal at eg. $7 for a heap of strawberries and chocolate sauce over a fresh waffle. Nothing quite like sitting by the fireplace in the dining room at breakfast with a bottomless cup of coffee, kids busy colouring and devouring waffles, then walking directly out onto the beach boardwalk to the great playground a few minutes\\' walk away. We didn\\'t have dinner there, ordered Indian from Amrikko\\'s and ate in the room (the hotel staff kindly supplied us with plates and cutlery).\\n\\nAmenities: Some of my favourite hotel bedding and mattresses, love those fresh white sheets. If I had to be picky about one thing, I\\'m not a fan of the strongly scented toiletries (think it\\'s supposed to be cucumber but it smells like men\\'s cologne).\\n\\nRooms: On this trip our families stayed in the Ocean View corner rooms in the tower, which offer a beautiful diagonal look down onto the beach and boardwalk. We once stayed in the non-view rooms (view of the parking lot)- so worth it to upgrade if possible! We hadn\\'t realized that the Ocean Front rooms are actually about twice as big as the Ocean View rooms on the same floor. We didn\\'t take those because it seemed silly to pay more for a slightly better view of the ocean, but worth it since the rooms seem to be much larger. Next trip.\\n\\nAlso planned for our next visit: trying out one of the rotating daily specials at the spa. Since everyone we met working there was so nice, one imagines that they\\'ve also hired a great massage therapist.\\n\\nDespite the rain (we appreciated the hotel loaner umbrellas), an ideal family trip.

We had an &quot;ocean view&quot; 1 bedroom suite, which was really a partial view of the ocean as we were on the side back from the corner of the tower, not ocean front as expected. More a view of the parking lot and highway and into the condo tower directly across. People watching opportunity I guess! The kitchen was really well stocked with full size appliances, real coffee cream. The place is starting to get dated, the carpet is stretched out and bunching in places. Would have liked some sheer curtains, as the only available curtains are black out drapes so if you want privacy you have to fully blacken the rooms. My other complaint is that housekeeping forgot us entirely on the second day of our stay despite having the sign on the door to make up the room. Just an average stay, not above and beyond, but quite nice, clean, right on the beach with a nice boardwalk. We ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant as we had a deal as part of the room cost, would not recommend it if you were paying a la carte as it was very small portions and very expensive, but food was good.

I was travelling with my 89 year old mother and when we checked in I was pointed to a luggage cart I could use.  Front desk staff watched while I manhandled the luggage cart to the car and loaded all our luggage, then after I got it back in and was headed toward where they said our room was, a staff member finally queried whether I needed assistance.  At that point my answer was no.  The first room we were given had a beautiful view, main floor and only 20 feet or so from the boardwalk and maybe 60 feet to the water.  The room was okay, nothing great but serviceable.  That night I had to call the desk due to noise in the next room.  It was after midnight. They said they could move us that night and that the room was part of a group there for a wedding the next day so it would probably be loud the next night too.  To their credit they did send someone to the room and it quieted down soon after.  In light of what they said I requested a new room (as long as it had the same view) for the next day and asked if they had a handicap room available because the side of the bathtub was so high there was no way my mom could get in on her own.  They told me they don\\'t have any handicap accessible rooms but they could put some grab bars in for her.  No handicap access - I thought that was mandatory but apparently not.  Anyway, the next morning I stopped at the desk and they confirmed they would move us and we didn\\'t need to do a thing.  I exchanged for our new room key and we went to the restaurant for breakfast.  The restaurant is a whole other problem that I will say more about but overall I\\'ll just say it was overpriced and extremely slow.  We waited over an hour for our meal and it was lukewarm when we got it.  But, back to the hotel itself.  I guess to ensure we didn\\'t have any further noise complaints they moved us to the top floor at the far end of the resort, as far from the elevator as you could get.  We had to walk outside from the elevator down to the far end of the resort.  They moved us here knowing full well that my mother uses a walker!  That night, my mom wanted to take a shower but even with the grab bars, I had to help her get in and out.  I am over 5\\'10&quot; and I had trouble stepping in because of arthritis.  We ate one dinner in the restaurant which was very good but very expensive.  Tried breakfast again the second morning and again waited a very long time and had to send it back because it wasn\\'t hot.  After that we ate at Smitty\\'s down the road.  Our second room had no ice bucket so I called for one, which never showed up.  I went down and got one from the desk eventually.  There is only one ice machine which was on the second floor, quite a distance from our room on the back forty.  Each room had a little sink and there was dish soap and a tea towel, which I wondered about.  Turns out they don\\'t replenish your glasses and coffee cups each day - you\\'re expected to wash them.  Sorry, when I\\'m on vacation paying good money at what is supposed to be a luxury resort, I do not want to do dishes!  They also didn\\'t bother to clean the bathroom sink or tub daily or replenish toiletries.  A room service tray with leftover food and dirty dishes sat outside a room down from us for a day and a half.  Honestly have had far better housekeeping and service from Super 8 motels.  The last straw was the noise of the heat/air conditioner fan.  Every time it cut in or out it woke you up so we eventually had to shut it off which made for chilly nights and was not at all conducive to a good sleep.  Overall I was very disappointed and will not be back, in hindsight we should have gone somewhere else after the second night instead of sticking it out for the four nights we booked.  Our last night they also closed more than half of the underground parking garage, which was the only place to park so we had to go quite a distance to the elevator which was difficult for my mom.",2,negative

Check in was fairly smooth, although no one offered to help with our bags so we went up to our room ourselves, unpacked and went for dinner at Prime. The food was only average unfortunately; however, the server was extremely friendly and very welcoming so dining service was 4/5 stars.\\n\\nIf you enjoy being out in nature, Parksville has lots to offer - definitely check out Cathedral Grove. Coombes has some pretty eclectic and fun attractions as well (Coombes Emporium &amp; goats on a roof - anyone?)\\n\\nAfter enjoying the local beach and heading out to several provincial parks over the past couple of days, we decided to check out some other attractions beyond the resort. We loaded up the car and proceeded to head out. Unfortunately, when leaving the garage this time the door came down on our car and damaged the vehicle. When we went to advise management that the garage gate came down on our vehicle - management immediately noted that it was 100% our fault!  More likely than not, management will say they have appropriate signage advising vehicles to come to a complete stop, etc. but this is simply their way of not accepting responsibility for a garage door that may not be working properly and clearly insufficient signage. It was a sunny day and as you approach to garage door, you can\\'t see the signage on the floor due to the glare from the sun. We had already stayed there a few nights and the gate didn\\'t close at all during the numerous times we left the parkade (it did close at night - but not during the middle of the day when we had gone in and out). When raising the issue with management, they even admitted that these types of incidents have occurred in the past on MULTIPLE occasions and claim that they have sufficient signage.  The thing is, if these incidents have and continue to occur, then signage is clearly insufficient. Again management will likely try to deflect and put the blame on their paying customers which is a really, really, really poor way to handle the situation. When asked why the garage door is sometimes kept open and at other times during the day it is closed, they noted it varies and again stated there is clear (?) signage to for drivers to stop. \\n\\nIn an effort to remediate the issue, we asked for partial compensation (what would have amounted to approximately one nights stay); however, was advised that the resort has NEVER offered compensation in the past for these types of incidents. Management may suggest that each instance is viewed on their own merit and that they review the security camera footage or come up with a wide range of reasons on why they are right but regardless, our family vacation was cut short because of the way management handled the situation and themselves. Given this is how management treats a certain population of their customers, we simply could not justify paying for any additional nights. \\n\\nA suggestion to prevent this from happening again would be to install a red stop sign at driver\\'s level line of sight rather than rely on it being painted on the ground (which is partially worn out by vehicles driving over it) and cannot be seen clearly. \\n\\nThis was an extremely disappointing stay that caused our family vacation to be cut short and we will not be coming back ever again and will certainly advise others of the miserable experience and management approach to resolving customer incidents.",1,negative

Despite it\\'s small population you\\'ll find everything you need here including vegan and gluten free pizza across the road, a variety of dining options, gift stores, exceptional second hand shops, and even a children\\'s store!  Do venture out and visit. We liked the ease of finding healthy fresh organic local food at the market as well as being able to walk to the top rated Trip Advisor restaurants in town, which were all busy. There seems to be an influx of new restauranteurs and creative entrepreneurs moving here who have determinedly created a new buzz for foodies.\\n\\nThe safety factor. You can let your kids run free on this beach and sit and watch from a log, or join in the fun of making sandcastles and digging moats and channels that will fill with the slow tide. Give them a pail and shovel and they will be entranced all day by shallow warm tidal pools with tiny shellfish, jewel-like seaweeds and wee scurrying crabs. Since the tide goes out slowly and so far, the ocean is only knee deep for the longest way. It returns in the same manner, slowly, without waves or any drop off. Perfect for kids! There are paddle boards available too. Check the tide charts at the front desk. \\n\\nWe bought this room online through a popular travel site, but you can also book directly with the resort on their informative website as they offer several attractive packages for guests. Our standard double queen room with covered patio in this 4 star resort was totally adequate for two adults and a child, spotlessly clean, had a wee kitchenette, included a patio table and chairs, and had a partial beach view. The only deficiency I noticed in our room was that the tub drain did not close properly; not so good for a long soak. Dishes and glassware and a coffee-maker were provided. There was a small kitchen sink and bar fridge. A microwave would have been helpful. \\n\\nOne observation I made was that there was really nowhere other than a drafty ledge to sit on by the indoor swimming pool if you wished to watch. A few benches or chairs would be nice for grandparents or guests, as well some towel hooks for the beach towels provided.\\n\\nNearby are mini golf and bumper boats, a community centre, golf courses, good fishing rivers, a hatchery, old growth forests, waterfalls, a cheese farm, and there is even a retro five pin bowling lane to take the family to! Be sure to drive into Coombs, a nearby mecca of gift shops, antique stores, and a wonderful and intriguing market with goats on the roof!  Enjoy your stay!",4,positive

I have stayed there before and had an very nice experience, and wanted to say again that it was a great weekend in a wonderful suite.  The view from our balcony over looking the beach was perfect, and unobstructed.  The room condition, furnishings and amenities were absolutely top notch and extremely comfortable.  In fact, I commented frequently that I would live there in a minute, if I had the opportunity!  The room service, which we had for breakfast one morning was actually reasonably priced and delivered promptly.  Warm and tasty, too!  The only thing that was even slightly less than perfect was that the balcony of our suite (415), although a wonderful view and supplied with a table and four chairs, was above the patio bar.  The sound of people chatting there seemed as if they were on the balcony with us.  Not a big deal, but the only negative.",5,positive

It was great that there is a full bathroom in the master bedroom (OMG, that huge shower and the soaker tub are the greatest), and then a half bath in the main area.

The in room laundry came in handy after both kids came back from the beach completely soaked. The room service for dinner was great, and having a pool was perfect for the kids to enjoy before bed! I was really impressed by the amount of life jackets available for kids at the pool also. Lots of sizes, and in girls and boys varieties. It\\'s these little things that make travelling with kids just a little easy.

It had been our 48th. anniversary a few days earlier, and decided to celebrate both events by booking three nights at The Beach Club Resort in Parksville.  Having stayed there on numerous occasions, we booked our favorite suite, the one bedroom ocean view suite.\\nWhen we arrived, I waited in the car while my wife went into register, and was surprised to see her come out with a nicely suited gentleman.  She introduced him as Arthur Wong, the manager of The Beachclub Resort, and he personally gave us a warm welcome!  \\nOur suite of course was spectacular...as was the view!  Everything was clean, orderly a and as usual...luxuriously appointed. The bathroom is beautifully presented and practical. Big towels, bath robes, large shower and a soaking tub to relax in. There is a deluxe kitchen with all the accessories if needed. In fact, we had old friends from the reunion up to join us to share stories and a libation.  They were blown away by our home away from home!  Unfortunately they stayed with a brother.  Aaah...we all make our choices...bad ones and good ones!!!\\nAlthough the weather was iffy, we walked the promenade out front, enjoying the views of the beach and water. I like to see the benches along the path with their memorial plaques paying homage to loved ones, who also must have enjoyed looking out at the spectacular scenery.\\nEven though the resort was booked solid for our three days there, we never noticed any of the personnel stressed out.  Everyone we encountered...even the maintenance man greeted us with a warm smile. \\nWe also dined at the Pacific Prime restaurant downstairs, for dinner and breakfasts, and I have to say, somebody got it and this restaurant has stepped up its game measurably!

I went and gathered everything from the car and brought it up to the upgraded &quot;ocean view&quot; room. Upon entering the room the most expansive view was of the next door trailer park. On top of that the fridge was dirty and the walls and floors were also not clean.\\nTo me it was not worth the $50 a night cost. Upon returning to the front desk I asked if I could wait for my original room or have an alternative. \\nThe front desk staff was incredibly friendly and apologetic, and offered to move us to another &quot;ocean view&quot; room on a higher floor, but neither room would be available right away. They said they would call me as soon as either was. At 4:15pm no one had called me so I checked back in with them. There was some confusion as to whether or not the luggage cart had been moved to the new room or not, so I went to the new room with my sandy wet kids &amp; my husband went to the room we did not want to stay in. 45 minutes later (kids bathed) my husband still had not made it to our new room. He had to wait for 5 elevators to be able to bring our luggage up!

I called to the front desk for service but by 2pm our room still had not been made up and I needed to nap my son. \\nWhile he was napping we got a note under the desk about the &quot;do not disturb&quot; door knocker saying that service would not be provided after 2pm! \\nVery frustrating. \\nThat same night we went for dinner and returned to find the parking garage full. As valet service was free it was just a mild inconvenience but an inconvenience none the less. \\nOn top of everything both our room keys stopped working at some point, which again on its own is not a big deal but in combination with the lack of room service or communication with the staff and the continually slow elevator service (which absolutely feels like a huge design flaw), I felt like my stay could have been so much better. \\nI will say that all of the staff was incredibly friendly and tried to be helpful, and the food at the restaurant was  really delicious (however I think the pricing should be added to your online menus).\\nI would just like to recommend that more staff is hired, so that the rooms can actually be cleaned, and that you pack your patience if you need to access the elevators  or use the underground parking. \\nI would also like to say that the 1 &amp; 2 bedroom suites seem to be the #1 priority for the hotel as if you are in any other rooms you are subjected to the terrible elevators &amp; do not have access to any self service laundry which on a beach holiday is very helpful.",4,positive

It might be simply sipping coffee and using your technology each morning with a warm fireplace to take off any chill and sooth you.\\n\\nThis is what we found at Beach Club and the quality and range of appliances and the attention to detail in architecture and finishings is second to none. Surely it is the sheer amount of room and full glass on the entire front allowing the outside in and visa versa.

Upon request, our bed was made, towels replaced, and garbages emptied. The other amenities were not replaced (shampoo, conditioner, etc).

Nice evening restaurant and &quot;Richard waiter&quot; made our evening special with his excellent service. We are well world travelers to numerous resorts and appreciated his attention to details of our orders, thank you. Lunch we had Casey L. and she is a sweet lady with a huge big heart and smile and we sure liked her dedication and great service. All the very best in your career! You are so very well suited for it. The underground parking nice but if you go out before the evening we found we could not park a few times. Difficult to turn around at the end, why not go out easy? Over load parking close by but outside so felt we had to take all valuables out of car. Location is good, just off the main highway and right on the beach with a boardwalk in front. Tracy booked us in, quick, calm, polite, very nice welcome and all details covered, thank you very much, nice lady for sure! Try to get a ocean front view 3rd or higher nice views of sunrise (quiet floor). Met Marcy M. good listener and communicator to visitor\\'s (tks for tip of Kalvas,ex!). I would suggest a day time bigger sign on the front of the entrance. Coming towards this area we did not see the sign on the stone pillar, even in our photo after! But I did see the high tower sign especially at night. Nice experience for new visitors to this resort and area. We would sure recommend this resort for teens or adults and will be back .Happytravels.",4,positive
data/ca/181779/1034305/569414631.html,Beach Club Resort - Bellstar Hotels &amp; Resorts,"""This hotel was booked as part of a package through BC Ferries Vacations so I didn\\'t know what to expect.  Along with the two nights accommodation and free parking at the resort, the package also came with two free appetizer coupons to use at the resort\\'s restaurant.  Check-in was efficient and there is underground parking with an overflow parking in a gravel area next to the resort.  The room I stayed in was on the 4th floor in the East Wing.  Although the room had a peekaboo view of the water, I was disappointed that the heating/cooling fan in the room sounded like a jet plane taking off every time it turned on.  There is no way to turn it off unless you do not want heat in the room.  I also noticed a bad odor on the carpet near the doorway. The smell was that of body odor or of pets.  I mentioned this to the cleaning staff and they said they would look into it but it was not addressed during our stay.  Upon checkout, I mentioned it again.  Hopefully they clean the area and get rid of the smell before the next customers. Also, the walls are very thin and you can hear conversations and children having fun.\\nThe bathroom was clean and tidy and the toiletries were good.  One nice touch is that this hotel collects all the customers\\' left over soap and it is sent off to a non profit organization that re-purposes the soap to make soap for countries where soap is a scarcity.  The room also had an in room safe, a fridge and a bar sink.  Another thing I found odd was that although there were plates, mugs, wine glasses, and two spoons, there was no microwave in the room to heat food up.  Unless you ordered take out that would give you cutlery, you would have to ask the restaurant for forks and knives.\\nOne of the best things about the resort is that it is right at the doorstep of a seaside boardwalk where you can take a nice stroll along the beach.  The view is spectacular and the tide goes way out.  If you bring gum boots, you could certainly stroll out onto the very sandy beach.  In the summer, it\\'s probably packed with beach combers looking for sand dollars and shells.\\nThe last thing I would like to mention is that the restaurant\\'s dinner menu is very expensive.  The highlight on the menu is the deep fried calamari and chorizo sausage.  You get a very generous helping of calamari and it is served with tzatziki and several slices of warm pita bread.\\nI would recommend this hotel for families and people wanting a short stay (2 or 3 nights vs. a week).  I would stay here again but ask for a different room with less smell!",4,positive

Of course, the views are spectacular.  As mentioned in previous posts, the room is smallish and the bathroom is tiny.  However, the beds were reasonably comfortable and the room, overall, was lovely.  It was nice to have free internet access and underground parking as well.\\n\\nReservations, check in/out process was excellent.  Housekeeping was good.  The pool and hot tub were excellent (the girls really enjoyed that).  Also handy was the fact that there were lifejackets and pool toys available for use.\\n\\nThe one area I would like to comment on is the Pacific Shores Restaurant.  We peered in the first day just to check things out and it looked really swanky.  But when I asked about the appropriateness for children, I was told that yes, it was indeed family-friendly and they even have a kids menu.  So, we decided to give them a try the next evening.  First the positives \\u2013 the staff were very friendly; service was excellent.  My entr\\u00e9e was delicious.  Now the negatives \\u2013 the kids\\u2019 menu consisted of the usual (i.e. mac/cheese, hamburgers, chicken strips, etc.)  each for $9.  My kids ordered the burger and fries.  When I asked what comes with it, I was told nothing \\u2026 and that kids usually prefer plain food.  To add a piece of lettuce, tomato and a couple slices of pickles would be $2 extra.  They also ordered a glass of milk (to the tune of $3.25 for a small glass).  As it turned out, the burgers were dry \\u2013 can\\u2019t imagine what they would\\u2019ve been without some basic toppings.  When the bill came, our waitress very kindly removed the $2 veggie charge (without prompting).\\n\\nIt would seem that I\\u2019m spending a lot of time talking about an incidental issue like $2 hamburger toppings and $3 glasses of milk.  But I want to bring to point a few things:  First, don\\u2019t suggest that your restaurant is family-friendly, when it clearly caters to adults only.  Second, to assume that kids prefer plain food is wrong\\u2026 especially when the children of families who stay at such resorts are usually accustomed to a higher standard and broader culinary experiences.  And finally, to charge (potentially) $5 for what should really just be included in the total meal charge is just simply petty.  Management is better off to price the kids\\u2019 meal at $10 per entr\\u00e9e and include these basics instead of nickeling/diming the customer.  The total charge on this 1 adult/2 kid dining experience came to $70.  I did include a 20% tip because I do value good service and food and don\\u2019t believe the staff should suffer what is clearly a poor management decision.\\n\\nOverall, I would consider staying at the Beach Club again but would agree with the Tripadvisor rankings for this area.

data/ca/181779/1103688/206346495.html,Sunrise Ridge Waterfront Resort,"""We selected Sunrise Ridge for the May (Victoria Day) long weekend based on location, price, and amenities - particularly the heated outdoor pool and fill kitchen/BBQ. \\n\\nThe property itself is in a good location, within a few minutes drive to Rathtrevor Beach or the main community beach in parksville. The beach at the property is basically non-existent (it\\'s a sliver of rock and muck at high tide with a switch-back trail to access it. We didn\\'t expect the onsite beach to be worth visiting (based on reviews) and this was accurate. Not a big deal though - the community beach is excellent. \\n\\nThe condo-type one-bedroom we were given at check-in (124A) was dark, with only one bathroom, and overlooked a drivway and adjacent trailer park. Previous reviews were adamant that you need to request the pool-side or view side and they were bang on! We requested a change and the friendly desk staff accommodated this. The pool side of the building (232A) was much nicer and the unit was more spacious with two baths. Not sure why the staff are not instructed to provide guests with the best available room, particularly first-time potential repeat guests. I am a former hotelier so I understand revenue and property management but the upside of &quot;wowing&quot; guests or providing anticipatory service (a family of four might want/need 2 baths vs a couple for example) is high. \\n\\nOur first impression of the room was good - well-appointed, qualty furnishings, ample and quality kitchen equipment. and a clean natural gas BBQ on the balcony. However, the choice of radiant in-floor heating was a poor one! As night fell, our unit was hot, very, very hot! The thermostat knob didn\\'t seem to reduce the heat and turned out to be broken (and had obviously been jury-rigged to stay on the wall with some glue). Tried to no avail to reduce the tempurature, thus the first night was spent with the windows open, fan on high, and with disrupted sleep for the kids who couldn\\'t sleep in the heat. Very early in the AM I approached the night front desk person about the issue and he was apologetic but agreed that the heat was a recurring issue because it take so long to make temperature changes and they had a history of the &quot;manifolds getting stuck&quot;.  The maintenance person who came midday on Saturday disconnected the thermostat completely and this reduced the heat everywhere except the 2nd bathroom which remained a proverbial sauna all weekend. \\n\\nWe enjoyed the pool Saturday, except for a brief closure due to a wedding mid-afternoon (not a huge issue but maybe in future notify incoming guests of closures or special events that impact their stay?). We went to the beach in lieu of the pool since it was sunny and it was a great afternoon. \\n\\nThe following night - Saturday night - we were awoken at approx 12:30am by water dripping, then increasing in flow from the light fixture above our bathtub! As it\\'s an open-concept bathroom in the bedroom it was loud and obviously a concern! I called the &quot;24hr&quot; front desk from 12:30 until around 1am with no response, then finally gave up. We filled the tub with towels and then set about trying to return the 3 and 7 yr olds back to sleep - hardly an easy task after a midnight &quot;emergency&quot;. Needless to say I was not impressed. I (corrctly) surmised that the water was the result of the poor shower design in the units that permits an unregulated flow of water onto the floor. The next day I notifed the desk agent who promised to call the upstairs unit to ask them to not shower &quot; too late&quot;. I\\'d be concerned about a potnetial mold issue between floors as well, but not my problem. \\n\\nSuffice to say, our stay was &quot;mixed&quot; - the property was beautiful but flawed, staff were friendly albeit apparently lacking empowerment to take decisive action to rectify guest stay issues. In my hotel past my team were empowered to offer compensation to guests upon receipt of these types of complaints; and no doubt this type of issue would have seen some follow-up from a manager as well just to assure the guest that the issue was being reviewed. We received an apology at check out, but I got the distinct impression that unless you are an owner here you shouldn\\'t expect more than that. They have no F&amp;B onsite to offer any sort of cursory compensation (like a breakfast etc. as you\\'d find in a normal hotel) and no room discount seemed to be forthcoming. \\n\\nMy experience here mirrored past stays at quarter-owned or timeshare type properties - it\\'s not a hotel and don\\'t expect it to be one. Accept that service and quality may fluctuate. If the price is low then go for it - but don\\'t &quot;buy high&quot; or you\\'ll leave dissapointed.",3,negative

Granted we were treated to a beachfront chalet, but our jaw dropped as we came in, saw the rooms, the bathrooms and the kitchen.  FULLY LOADED.  Even the wine bottle opener was found.  LCD screens in each bedroom made my teenager jump for joy.  The large beds were a huge treat.  Then we scampered to the promised view.  Nothing but amazement filled us.  The beach, the ocean, righ there.  I mean RIGHT there.  Then we the dinner plans changed as we noticed the delux gas BBQ and the heater outside.  The next morning was no less magical.  The sunrise (er the name of the resort was breathtaking.  We enjoyed it so much that we considered not continueing to the west coast of the Island.  We relunctantly left. \\n\\nThe wonderful welcome at check in, the flexibility with our booking, the fully loaded suite and top notch quality of the facilities... we felt like high society, or royalty.

The location is quite a long ways to the beach, and had virtually no views (maybe a small peek at the horizon).  If you want views, then you need to get the Waterfront Villa (there are 4 of these units).  They seem to have plans to build a pool right in front of the 100 building and have earmarked some trees for removal, but when we were there, there are absolutely no signs of construction life.   Not sure if the recession/credit crisis is taking a toll.  Very quite, but if you want beach front, this has none and really no views (even though they tell you they will try to get a view for you...).  We were there for the Aug 1-3 long weekend (hot hot) and guess what, no A/C throughout the property.  You\\'d think that if you\\'re paying for luxurious accomodations, you should get AC).  They included 2 stand fans in our unit, one for each bedroom.\\n\\nOther than the above cons, the unit was very nice, exactly like the pics in the website.  Kitchen is well stocked with all utensils and basic cookware. Bedding good.   Clean unit. There\\'s a washer dryer which is very handy.  Balcony has a simple BBQ (don\\'t expect a weber!).   The 100 building is far away from the beach, so can\\'t hear any waves lapping on the beach.  TVs in living room and bedrooms.   Water pressure in bathrooms not high enough.  No room service except to clean the trash and exchange towels.    Pool and Hot Tub (for 16 persons) expected to be complete by next spring.  I don\\'t see how since no ground has been broken for this construction yet.   \\n\\nWe had 2 little kids and when we stayed at the Beach Blub Resort last year, that resort had an easier to access beach and had incredible views.  So, if you want unobstructed views, and views of the cruise ships passing by at night then go to Beach Club.  You can also hear the waves lapping on the beach as you sleep at night at the Beach Club.   The Beach Club did have one drawback; that is, it is on a public beach and there may be some rowdy folks hanging out on the beach and partying, making noise while you\\'re trying to sleep.  If you\\'re looking for taking pics of the sunrise and sunset, then head to Beach Club.\\n\\nWe would recommend that our friends try this place in 2-3 years as it seems to be a long ways from being spectacular...it is on its way though.",4,positive

They have the option for large suites and ocean front suites as well, which we would consider doing next time. It was a little awkward as you have to enter in to a common area with 2 suites and your room will either be the A or B Side.

Having separate hotel style rooms would be very beneficial I think.\\n\\nIt was great walking along the beach in the evening, looking out to the ocean and enjoying the nice weather, the location was nice. The downside to the location is that as it is in a more secluded area there were limited options for dining. There is no dining on site so you can either walk to the resort beside and eat there (quite pricey) or you have to drive in to town. \\n\\nWe booked the Monkey around package which gave us a $100 Gift card to the Element Play Wild Park, which was a great value s our whole stay for 2 night was under $400 and that included the gift card to the park which we put towards Bungy Jumping. We had a more difficult time booking the activity as when we booked they were not taking reservations for activities at the park yet and when we called back in May as requested they said they couldn\\'t make the reservation until closer to the date. We called again 1 week before we left, the reception took our preferred time told us they would book it, and upon arrival they had not done so yet. We inquired on the process, if we should call and book it or not and they told us that they would take care of it. Again, we told them the next morning would be perfect as we had other plans for the day. We called the front desk again around 5 PM to see if they had booked it, and were told yet again that they were unsuccessful. At this point the park was closed and we would have to wait until the morning. The next morning we inquired on the reservation and were told we were better off just to go there and &quot;maybe&quot; the reservation was made after all. We drove to the park, talked to the manager of the park and he was unaware that Sunrise Ridge even offered this package at their hotel. He did not have a gift certificate nor did they have an account to charge the &quot;$100 gift card&quot; to. We ended up having to call the hotel, getting the hotel to speak with the park, provide a credit card for the $100 so we could apply it to our total (which we did the primal swing and bungy).\\n\\nOther than the incident with booking the reservation and the package, this hotel was a nice stop. We didn\\'t spend much time there, but we did enjoy the nights sleep and the beach.

There is also a public fire place that is used in the evening for small gatherings, weddings, or a romantic spot for two. The only reason the facility hasn\\'t achieved a perfect rating is because the walk to the water is a little far and not accessible to all ages and abilities.

When we came back, we actually walked through one of the other resorts\\' access and walked on the street to get back.\\n\\nThe only way to get to the 2nd floor is by elevator which, if you\\'re located at the end of the hall, means a long walk and potential wait.

Our room was fantastic, two bathrooms, each witha shower, lofted ceilings and an ocean view. The kitchen was perfectly outfitted and while we didnt use it much, would be great if you like to cook your own meals while on vacation. \\n\\nThe complimentary gym passes were well worth it, this was by far one of the top athletic facilities i have ever used! Well worth the 5 minute drive down the road. \\n\\nThe resort is located at the far end of the beach past other resorts in the area but the beach is rocky, if you like sand castles, you will need to walk a bit down the beach.

Room was clean and comfy bed moderately soft, and fit my needs.  The renovated rooms have very nice updated bathrooms, nicer than many higher Choice properties, comparable to a nice Clarion at least.  Yes the property is older, and as such needs to have renovations done one part at a time, so frequently you may find work being done somewhere.  From an architectural POV, the building is fairly nice for its age.  I had no issues with the building/property as a whole.  Also in room coffee locally roasted, nice to see that as a change.\\n\\nNow time for some constructive feedback that will make this place a 5 instead of a 4.\\n1. Have microwave and fridge in all rooms (We did have a fridge in ours, so that was nice)\\n2. Need some sort of automatic doors for those that are mobility challenged (auto doors or button to activate a motorized mechanism)\\n3. This is MY big one, breakfast... Not including any breakfast is a bit disappointing.  Offering a discount coupon/voucher would be easiest way, and slightly increasing room rates to comp that, would also drum up more traffic to the onsite restaurant.  I know if a Choice Hotel property has an onsite restaurant they are not required to include a meal, but even many Econo Lodge provide something basic.  So GM of the Quality Resort, please consider this idea.\\n\\nOverall a good place, may stay again when in the area.  Keep improving I would love to see this place rise in th TA rankings.",4,positive

I had been there to visit friends before but never for a multi day summer vacation.\\n\\nThe reason I wanted to go to Parksville / Rathtrevor Beach was that as a child, our family  always spent our summer vacation camping here. I also lived on the Island for many years when I was young and although my family and I live in Vancouver, I rarely get across the straight anymore so this year I really wanted to take the time to show my kids the places I loved when I was a kid. \\n\\nThe remarkable thing is that Rathtrevor beach is essentially the same as it was when I was first there 44 years ago. Other than a few more resorts on the Southern end, it is the same amazing beach it has always been. A family can play for hours, day after day and never get tired of this spectacular playground. When the tide comes in over the warm sand late in the afternoon, you could be forgiven for thinking you were swimming in the waters of baja or Mexico.\\n\\nAs for Beach Acres, it is a great little spot. Close to the water, comfortable cabins / townhouses, excellent staff, it was a great choice for my families first Parksville vacation. My wife is thinking of booking for next year later this week.\\n\\nWe shared the Cabin with a friend and his two kids so there was 7 of us in the unit. Although it slept everyone by adding a queen size mattress in the loft, that number of people was a tad taxing on the bathroom. We only had to run one of the kids over to the main building to go to the bathroom once but there was some leg crossing.\\n\\nIf you are a one kid family, there are a ton of kids around for your child to befriend and play with. There is a kids club with trained staff who do activities from morning till dusk. They provide you with shovels for epic sandcastle building and there are a TON of other amenities you can take advantage of.\\n\\nPrice was... A wee bit steep but by sharing with another family it instantly became reasonable. Having kitchenettes also saves on meal costs and most day trips that you might take are close enough that you are not spending a fortune on gas.\\n\\nI would and do recommend Beach Acres as a summer vacation spot.",4,positive

We have stayed at Beach Acres in the past, but not with both of our kids, and before we were right on the beach in a smaller 2 bedroom cabin. I like that the townhouse had a bedroom downstairs with two twin beds instead of bunk beds, which my 2 year old and 4 year old are not quite ready for. There was also another twin bed along with the queen bed upstairs, which we were planning on using as a backup if one of our kids got scared or couldn\\'t sleep (which we didn\\'t need to use) the upstairs bedroom was very large and had a great view and a patio. The floor was extremely squeaky on one side of the bed, so I had to be very careful not to wake everybody up. The main downside of the townhouse is there is only one washroom and it isdownstairs. The staff were great. We were there over easter weekend and they set up some fun family activites including a scavenger hunt, colouring contest and an easter egg hunt. They even had a tall skinny staff member dressed as the easter bunny! We didn\\'t try the pool, but it is indoors. It was a short walk down the hill to beautiful rathtrevor beach. We will definately stay here again, and may ask for a 2 bedroom cabin on the beach level without a view, as these looked much larger than the beachfront ones and the kids could run around in the yard without worrying about them going onto the beach by themselves.",4,positive

We were also disappointed upon arrival Thursday Aug 28 to learn that the Kids Klub had closed up shop for the year despite clear indication on the website that this program ran through August. It\\'s a beautiful setting/property but the whole resort is in desperate need of some updating nevermind a few more bare essentials in the miniscule kitchens.

Upon arrival, the staff was very welcoming, and by the time we were finished signing our life away and making sure we agreed to doing all the dishes, or else....remove the garbage....or else...agreed to paying for all the rentals of everything, we were a little put off.  Reading the earlier reviews and the response, I do understand where they are coming from, but a little more coffee (which I did not know you could get at the office) would have been nice to have a little extra at the cottage.  The office staff did ask us to come to them if we needed anything, but by that time, we did not want to ask.  All can be overlooked for the most amazing view and setting of the place.  The most annoying thing was the lack of sound proofing in the walls and lack of privacy...a cackle of hens next door stayed up until all hours in the morning, by which time one is too tired to get up and ask them to quiet down. When we woke up in the morning at 8, enjoying our coffee on the patio outside, whispering quietly to enjoy the tranquility and amazing scenery, it took only a few minutes before the neighbours got up and continued where they had left off. Luckily we decided to go to the beach and enjoyed a beautiful walk. The next morning we tried to enjoy the \\'tranquility\\' again outside our patio, when the \\'cleaning staff\\' needed to spring clean the cottage clanking away inside and clean the outside patios with a leaf blower.

Nice touch was a Christmas tree set up, dog bed (we did bring our own but a lovely gesture) and dog bowls and a biscuit. Loved the cottage we were in.

Each option has its pros and cons. We wanted an open view of the ocean so we booked ahead for an Ocean-view townhouse. It was not possible to request a specific unit, we were told, as the units are all privately-owned and scheduling is difficult to juggle. Our preferences were noted and there were no guarantees beyond being assured there were units available along that row, above the beach. When we arrived, sure enough, we were assigned to Unit #40, towards the end of the row.\\n\\nUnit #40, is named \\u201cGulf View\\u201d (Each unit has its own nickname).  Most of the units along this row have clear views of the water, through a few scattered trees; only those on the far left have more trees in front of them. Our unit had a good view. It was clean, very quiet, and bright, with a gas fireplace and large screen TV. Note: no dishwasher in the kitchen, and only one bathroom, on the ground level. The upper loft has a queen bed and its own deck outside; a small second bedroom is on the ground floor, and has two single beds. The bathroom has good cupboard storage. The bank of vanity lights above the mirror are on the dim side; there is no hair dryer, and the shower/bathtub has a hose/showerhead combo with strong water pressure that is non-adjustable.\\nRestaurant: The Black Goose. If you don\\u2019t want to go into town to eat, then this English-style pub is on-site and has good basic fare. Place your food and drink order in \\u201cThe Snug\\u201d bar, a small room off the main dining hall. This will start a tab under your name. Take your drinks to your table and when your food is ready the bar attendant will bring it over to you.\\n\\nBeach access: a small beach trail down the center of the bluff has been closed even though it still shows on the resort map card available at the Office. Instead, the main driveway takes you on a short walk down to the beach level, and from there the beach is right ahead of you. Rathtrevor Park is close by, on the left. Lots of beachcombing and forest trails to explore. When the tide is out, you can walk halfway out into the bay, over the vast sand flats.\\nNote: if you book a Beach level cabin, be ready to put up with construction noise from the condo development immediately to your left, between the resort and Rathtrevor Park.\\n\\nOffice: The staff are courteous and knowledgeable. A full-size indoor swimming pool with change rooms is down a short hallway. The pool area includes a 6 x 6 hot tub spa with jets controlled by a wall timer. There is also a dry sauna. Note: If you plan on using the sauna, phone the Office 30 minutes ahead of time so that they can get it started for you; it takes that long for it to get warm enough in there.  \\n\\nSummary: For a quiet getaway at reasonable prices, this resort is very recommendable, especially for families with young children.",4,positive

The forest cabins are a bit off the beach but are well appointed self contained detached units so noisy &quot;you&quot; or your noisy &quot;neighbours&quot; are not a problem. Parking is right out side your units so schlepping all the crap you brought along is not too arduous. No need to bring food as there are lots of great quality food and liquor stores nearby so less to pack and a good selection of quality restaurants all over. We opted to bring our own self contained briquette BBQ as I wanted to cook out the back door - recommend doing this if you like the BBQ.

These are spacious two floor units with excellent floor plans for families. On the main floor there was a bedroom, bathroom, and decent sized living room and kitchen. There was a pleasant wood burning fireplace, they supply a light and leave it log but you have to pay for any additional firewood you want which was a mild annoyance but I guess it helps keeps the rates down. There is also a patio off the living room but for our unit it just look out over the road and other units so I probably wouldn\\'t use it much even in summer. Upstairs there was a single huge bedroom with a double (or possibly a queen) bed along with bunk beds, there was also a decent sized deck with a small but beautiful view of the ocean. My in-laws suite was much the same but with two single beds and a queen in place of the bunk beds in the upstairs bedroom. Their suite also had an ocean view from the downstairs which made it a little nicer.\\n\\nAlthough the resort is obviously getting on in years, it\\'s been very well looked after and had all sorts of amenities you wouldn\\'t find in a more modern place.

The views of the beach were wonderful, either from inside through the large windows or from outside on the patio or the upstairs deck. We could see when the tide was out and then could dash down the stairs and walk for kilometres on the sea bottom. Being up top also meant we were close to the restaurant and swimming pool. The cottage was very quiet and we expect that the beachside and forest cottages would be equally so.\\n\\nOur end unit was very comfortable and well equipped. We cooked scallops purchased at the French River Marina - a true treat. Parking was outside the door. The staff at the front desk were very friendly and  helpful.
